    <h1>Hawksmead:&nbsp;Sleipnir</h1>
    

    <p><img alt="" src="https://www.lancashiremeadcompany.co.uk/images/detailed/1/sleipnir.jpg"></p>
<p>Made with raw honey and treacle, this is a very dark mead from
<a href="/the-lancashire-mead-company/">The Lancashire Mead Company</a>. This mead from their &#8220;Hawksmead&#8221; range is named Sleipnir after
Odin&#8217;s war horse (and Loki&#8217;s son &#8212; now that&#8217;s a&nbsp;story!)</p>
<p>From their own&nbsp;website:</p>
<pre><code>From Loki we have therefore created 'son' of Loki. Tasting like treacle toffee, this is a sweet, dark mead against the savoury of Loki. Cleverly disguising it's 17% abv, it deposits a delicious and delectable hint of treacle toffee on the palate, that leaves you wanting more!

Sleipnir, the son of Loki. Loki was a shape-shifter and appeared as a stallion and bred with a mare. The result was Sleipnir, an eight legged horse. Such was the speed that Sleipnir could travel that Odin, the All-father, took him as his war horse.
</code></pre>
<p>A lot of homebrewers like to use maple syrup, molasses or treacle instead of honey. When maple syrup is fermented alone, it is known as
<a href="/types-of-mead/">Acerglyn</a>. In this case, however, the ingredients seem to be a mix of raw honey and treacle, so I suppose this is still technically a&nbsp;mead.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>The colour is what you&#8217;d expect from something containing treacle. It is dark with honey colours only highlighting the meniscus of the liquid. At 17% <span class="caps">ABV</span>, the legs are quite noticeable if you swirl the glass&nbsp;around.</p>
<h2 id="nose">Nose</h2>
<p>The aroma is almost exactly that of treacle toffee. There is little in terms of an overpowering alcohol scent at&nbsp;all.</p>
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>
<p>Clearly, treacle toffee is a perfect flavour if you are looking to hide the alcohol in a drink. The first sip is a bold taste of liquid treacle toffee with a substantial mouth feel approaching that of a single cream (or at least whole milk). There is a small amount of heat from the alcohol in the finish only. The toffee notes hang on into the aftertaste for a very pleasing finish&nbsp;indeed.</p>
