    <h1>Scottish&nbsp;Meads</h1>
    

    <p>The most famous mead associated with Scotland is probably
<a href="/moniack-mead/">Moniack mead</a>. It is named after Moniack castle near
Inverness, but production has moved down to Devon after
<a href="/highland-wineries/">Highland Wineries</a> was fully bought by
<a href="/lyme-bay-winery/">Lyme Bay Winery</a>. We have kept the &#8220;Scottish&#8221; tag on this
mead to honour its history, but we must also acknowledge truly Scottish mead
producers&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>The most impressive we have come across so far is <a href="/the-rookery/">The Rookery</a>,
who produce <a href="/craft-mead/">Craft Mead</a> in&nbsp;Perthshire.</p>
<p>We have struggled so far to find more producers in Scotland. England seems
to be dominating the more modern &#8220;craft&#8221; scene with trendy producers such
as <a href="/zymurgorium/">Zymurgorium</a> while both Wales and South-West England do
well for the more traditional approaches with
<a href="/new-quay-honey-farm/">New Quay Honey Farm&#8217;s Afon Mêl</a> and
<a href="/lyme-bay-winery/">Lyme Bay</a>.</p>
<p>Do you know of any more producers in Scotland we are yet to find? Please let us know in the&nbsp;comments!</p>
