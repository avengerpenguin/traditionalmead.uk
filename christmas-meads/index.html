    <h1>Christmas&nbsp;Meads</h1>
    

    <p>Christmas is the best time of year for food and drink lovers. Not only does the festive season bring a good excuse to spend more on a wider variety of foods and beverages, but the approach of the Winter nights draws more of us inside with family and&nbsp;friends.</p>
<p>What better way to get through the Winter than with warm, comforting food and sharing a variety of drinks with&nbsp;friends?</p>
<p>Mead serves well as a dessert wine as well as a drink on its own, so it clearly perfect after Christmas dinner or for any Christmas party. It is at Christmas time though where a sweet, spiced <a href="/metheglin-spiced-mead/">metheglin</a> comes into its&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>Christmas is widely associated with sweet treats and sweet spices such as cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, so it should be no surprise that many mead producers market some form of &#8220;Christmas mead&#8221; where they have made a metheglin flavoured with these precise&nbsp;spices.</p>
<p>The meads below are any produced that are labelled explicitly as a
&#8220;Christmas mead&#8221; as opposed to just any metheglin. This normally shows a bias towards the Christmas spices and they might be the best pairings with your Christmas pudding this&nbsp;year!</p>
