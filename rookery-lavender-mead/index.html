    <h1>The Rookery Lavender&nbsp;Mead</h1>
    

    <p><img alt="Picture of Rookery Lavender Mead" src="/images/rookery-lavender-mead.jpg"></p>
<p>The many flavours of so-called &#8220;Scottish craft mead&#8221; from
<a href="/the-rookery/">The Rookery</a> can be hard to find online. We managed to get hold
of some flavours, one of which is this &#8220;Lavender&nbsp;Mead&#8221;.</p>
<p>The notes on the bottle say that this mead is made with dried lavender to give a sweet mead with floral&nbsp;notes.</p>
<p>The Rookery is based on Perthshire and claims to use only honey in their fermentation &#8212; never sugars or syrups. They also claim to use hand-foraged ingredients when making flavoured meads, so perhaps this is hand-foraged lavender in this&nbsp;case.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>A golden yellow somewhere right in the middle of the spectrum between a darker mead such as <a href="/lyme-bay-traditional-mead/">Lyme Bay Traditional Mead</a> and a pale <a href="/pyment/">Pyment</a> like <a href="/lindisfarne-mead/">Lindisfarne&nbsp;Mead</a>.</p>
<h2 id="nose">Nose</h2>
<p>I could smell this one just as I poured it! The lavender bursts out of the bottle into the surrounding air without pause. On a closer nose, there are subtle notes of sweetness, but it&#8217;s hard to deny that the lavender dominates the&nbsp;bouquet.</p>
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the lavender is the strongest component of the taste. There still manages however to be an undertone of mead body to carry that floral&nbsp;bouquet.</p>
<p>The taste was a challenge for me as I had to make a conscious effort to separate the lavender scent from associations of soap and other bathroom products. That association is not warranted as there is nothing &#8220;soapy&#8221; about the mead, but perhaps lavender is just such an unusual taste to find in a mead and my palate is&nbsp;confused.</p>
<p>After a few sips, it grows as a perfectly pleasant drink similar to any other of the more floral fruit wines (such as elderflower). Definitely a unique experience&nbsp;overall.</p>
<p>I can say for sure that such a strong taste masks well the supposed 17% alcohol&nbsp;strength!</p>
