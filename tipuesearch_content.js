This brew certainly grabs the attention with promises of \"White Creamy Mexican Honey, Cocoa-Nibs, Vanilla, Phoenix & El Dorado Hops And A Wee Pinch Of Deseeded Mild Ancho Chillies\". Ah-Muzen-Cab or Ah Mucen Cab is apparently a Mayan god of bees and honey, so Zymurgorium were motivated to dedicate a craft mead based on flavours familiar to his worshippers. The ingredient list boasts an impressive: White Mexican honey & wildflower honey fermented. Hopped with Phoenix and El Dorado hops. Also flavoured with cocoa nibs, vanilla and ancho chillies. Appearance This drink has a cloudy, pale yellow colour. The fizz is quite lively on first pour, but it calms down quickly. Nose Definite notes of apricot on the nose. Ancho chilli notably absent from the aroma, but it is supposedly kept mild in this respect. Taste A complex drink on first sip. There are peach and apricot fruit flavours that naturally come through. The chocolate and vanilla seem to add to the complexity of the overall body without being distinctive tastes in their own right. The finish leads to the chilli taste which can linger for some time as a pleasant, mild, slow burn. This is perhaps a medium sweet. The honey sweetness is still present, but not as pronounced as many other meads.

It was started by a married couple, Hugh and Hilary, in 1981. Hugh was already a cider-maker at the time, so they created a cider orchard along with other fruits for diversity. The inclusion of additional fruits seems to have been key to their success in diversifying their product range. They follow \"organic principles\" in everything they make, whether it is cider, fruit wine, liqueurs or — most importantly — mead. They also make English grape wine. Naturally resistant vines that do not need fungicide are used and they have won Soil Association awards recognising their organic credentials. They claim most of their production is powered by solar energy since 2011. Their farm shop is open to visitors where you can have free tastes of their products or even get guided tours. Everything they sell is also available for sale on their website . In terms of mead, they appear to have just two products: an organic Pure Honey Mead and an organic mead liqueur.

This is distinct from a Metheglin (Spiced Mead) (where sweet spices and herbs are used) as the goal with these recipes is to add a peppery heat to the drink. Food with a chilli heat is typically difficult to pair with wines, with beer being the more common choice to drink with things like Indian curries. This difficulty comes from the effect whereby alcohol exacerbates the burning sensation from hot chillies. The dry acidity from typical white grape wines tends to pair poorly with spicy food as well. The aim with a capsicumel is to embrace that increased burn sensation from the combination of the alcohol and the heat. This is, of course, down to personal taste as to whether that strong burning sensation is desirable or not. It cannot be denied however that there is a market even for chilli vodka. The flavour profile is not always so extreme though. It is common to suggest low-acid, off-dry or sweeter wines with spicy food, so mead by itself pairs quite nicely with heat. In fact, one of our favourite combinations is New Quay Honey Farm Afon Mêl Apricot Mead with Middle Eastern or Indian food. The pairing works because the sweetness is decreased by the presence of chilli heat in the mouth. This not only makes dry wines inappropriate (they would taste even more dry), but reducing the pure sweet taste in the mouth gives a chance for other flavour characteristics to emerge. This is something you can find in dry meads where other honey flavours are more apparent when more sugar is fermented away. As a result, with a (potentially) very sweet drink like mead, simply adding a little bit of chilli heat can add subtle complexity. One great example of this is the Ah Mucen Cab Chilli Craft Mead . This drink has only a small amount of heat and has great complexity as a result of this (as well as all the other flavourings!).

Nose I expected cherry to be more pronounced and aromatic on the nose, but this drink's aroma is surprisingly muted with the cherry hidden behind a more general fruit nose.

Some have attributed it to TV shows like Game of Thrones, but a lot of newer producers seem to have taken inspiration from the rise of craft beer and cider. In a traditional mead recipe, it is common to ferment until fermentation stops naturally. This produces a wine-strength drink with residual sugar left in most cases (since honey is so high in sugar) as most yeasts will be killed off around 14% to 15% ABV . However, we are now seeing meads from producers such as Zymurgorium, Gosnells, and Mabinogion made in the 5% to 7% ABV range. These are more comparable (and drinkable) like a craft beer. The prolific Scottish producer, The Rookery , makes mead under the \"craft mead\" label as well, but their offerings are higher than wine strength even. In this case, it appears they are referring to the small-batch, hand-made approach to their mead production. These \"craft\" meads represent a very modern revival of mead. While there is also a rise in producers making traditional meads, melomels and metheglins, the craft producers are bringing some unusual twists and eccentric creativity in some cases. We only have to look at anything made by Zymurgorium to see the embodiment of the craft movement out of Greater Manchester in the form of mead, gins and liqueurs. Their meads — as it the case with Gosnells — are all made to beer strength and sold in 300ml bottles. In fact, in many cases their labels would blend in with a fridge full of craft beers.

A dry mead is an interesting experience as the dryness is arguably bringing out the fundamental, base qualities of the original honey.

When we use honey as a fermentable (or a flavouring in things like pyment , this is hardly surprising given honey is a strong concentration of sugar. This differs from say, wine, where grapes are indeed sweet like many fruits, but the sugar is balanced with bitter skins and also water and acid in the flesh. This leads to a lower amount of sugar overall that goes into the fermentation process. If you use similar yeasts for both wine and mead production and ferment until the process naturally stops (the yeast will naturally die off once you reach 14% to 15% ABV ), you will get much residual sugar still left in mead whereas grape wine will ferment to dry. This means a typical, traditional Pure Honey Mead will be a sweet drink with typical wine strength around 14% ABV . However, there are many exceptions. Firstly, we are now seeing meads from producers such as Zymurgorium , Gosnells , and Mabinogion made in the 5% to 7% ABV range. These are more comparable (and drinkable) like a craft beer. And secondly, it is possible for mead to be made in a range of sweet to dry as you get with cider and wine. On this page, we have a list of meads that are known to be made to a dry style. What makes dry mead interesting is that it brings out a more distilled honey flavour, which can lead to more complex tastes on the palate.

Apple meads and cysers are a natural pairing to meat dishes. In some cases, it's been known for people to use them as marinades for pork or chicken. Given the Breton origin of this mead ( Chouchen ), I would imagine this an excellent drink to wash down galettes stuffed with ham and cheese. Appearance The drink manages to come out with almost the exact colour of apple juice. The colour is a light autumn brown with pleasing translucency. Nose Again, the aroma takes on more character of apple juice rather than cider. This could be the sweetness from the honey in the mead. The scent takes on the intensity you would expect from condensed apple flavours such as the flavourings used in confectionery. Taste The palate is met with an immediate, notable (but not too intense) body of sweet apple.

Produced by Liqueurs Fisselier , this is the \"classic\" pure honey where their other offerings normally have a fruit flavouring. The bottle says to drink it chilled, but I read that after pouring a glass so I have tasted it both at room temperature and chilled. It is apparently drunk as an apéritif (French for apéritif ). Appearance This one is very much a honey colour: a deep orange-yellow colour. Nose Much like the colour, the aroma is simply that of honey. Many meads do not achieve a true honey aroma, so it is impressive to experience a robust retention of the pure sight and smell of honey itself in the fermentation process. Taste The initial taste is a surprise: not nearly as strong as the aroma would suggest, but then the flavours build up for a strong aftertaste. The sweetness has hints of caramel such that it reminds of Moniack Mead or maybe even Lyme Bay Traditional Mead , but there is additional complexity. The additional flavours are similar to the deep sweetness of apple juice, which fits the original tradition of making Chouchen with apples or cider. I believe this mead is made purely with honey however.

Nose The first whiff gives up a nice grapefruit aroma, but slight chemical notes come shortly after. As with a lot of citrus fruits these days, it's hard not to be reminded of washing-up liquid when you smell the flavour. Taste The initial sip brings all the sweet flavours first.

This mead is another Chouchen in the Hydromelix range from the Brittany-based producer Liqueurs Fisselier . It is suggested to have these meads as an aperitif before dinner, but this flavour is likely better as a dessert wine to accompany rich desserts such as cheesecakes. Such a strong, sweet taste is likely to be too intense as a pre-dinner drink. Appearance Unsurprisingly, this mead has taken the caramel colour from its flavouring. It has a deep orange-brown translucency and a nice clarity. Nose Notes of caramel and confectionery are immediately obvious on the nose and it is not a subtle flavour. There is honey in the bouquet as well, but it takes a back seat to the flavouring. Taste The initial sip brings all the confectionery as promised by the aroma. There is a little bit of body and chewiness from the caramel, but not overly so. The length of the flavour is surprising, however, with a the alcohol and a little bit of tartness coming in for the aftertaste. It is certainly more complex than you might expect.

It's a fantastic Summer flavour and pairs nicely with desserts and even salads. Appearance The colour is a deep red clearly taken directly from the strawberries. It might be indistinguishable from strawberry juice in colour, but there is a vibrant glow to it. Nose A huge bouquet of strawberry aroma hits the nose before you're anywhere near the glass! The aroma's intensity hints that the very essence of strawberry flavour is condensed into this drink. Taste Some tartness, sourness and alcohol stands out on the first taste. A well-balanced body of strawberry flavour and sweetness quickly follows and the finish is surprisingly complex with the fruit sweetness carried by a small amount of dryness. With the aroma, I would have assumed this to be sweet like a modern flavoured cider, but it's definitely a much more interesting drink. The bright colour of this drink would have you judge it as a sickly sweet \"alcopop\" drink, but with its complexity this could easily pair with a lot of fresh, Summer dishes such as salads and would actually be best to avoid with very sweet desserts as you want to keep your drink just that little bit sweeter than the food.

Appearance It's subtle, but I think this is slightly darker and more golden than the spiced mead they make . The viscosity is still not the highest, so I'm expecting a reasonable amount of sugar is fermented away as with the traditional mead . Nose The aroma seems less intense than their spiced mead and perhaps more rounded and fruitier. The honey base is more pronounced and forms part of the bouquet rather than being masked by the spice flavours. Taste The initial sip brings a bigger hit of spice than the other spiced offering. There is a little sourness or citrus-style zest in the middle, which hints that maybe they have flavoured it as such as is the case with Lyme Bay Christmas Mead mead. The honey base packs more of a punch in the middle and the taste is shorter, again comparing it to their other metheglin.

They hand-craft liqueurs and meads in small batches (under 100 litres). They are predominantly a producer of liqueurs with a series flavoured vodka liqueurs, gin liqueurs and most importantly a handful of meads. In this respect, you might consider them a liqueur producer who includes mead in their range rather than a dedicated mead maker. Whether there is any benefit of such a focus is something you can judge yourself by drinking! Many of their drinks are sold in bottles with interesting shapes, such as Christmas trees, heart shapes or stars, which could make them a good choice for interesting gifts. So far, we have got our hands on a traditional (pure honey) mead, a spiced mead (metheglin), a \"Christmas mead\" which is also spiced and finally a mead liqueur from their \"Classic Collection\". This collection is made up of other fruit-based liqueurs such as apple, ginger, apricot brandy and a sloe liqueur. There are many others of course, but our focus will be on the mead liqueurs! As Friary specialise in all sorts of liqueurs, there isn't much specific information given about the ingredients for their meads or the kind of honey used. Again, a dedicated mead maker might want to show off a bit more with their choice of ingredients. Their website does claim however that they select and source the \"finest ingredients\", so given their hand-crafting approach I would assume they have put some thought into it!","tags":"Friary Liqueurs","url":"https://traditionalmead.uk/friary-liqueurs/","loc":"https://traditionalmead.uk/friary-liqueurs/"},{"title":"Friary Mead Liqueur","text":"Friary Liqueurs make an interesting mead liqueur in their \"classic collection\". It is blended with a 3 year old blended Scottish whisky and weighs in at 18% ABV . Their recommended recipe is a cocktail blending this liqueur stirred with a dash of their butterscotch liqueur. I've not tried it, but let me know in the comments if you do! Appearance The colour is a light golden colour with some good legs on the glass from the 18% ABV . I think the body looks thinner than I imagined given I was expecting similarities with Drambuie, but Friary seem to keep their mead drinks from being overly sweet. Nose The alcohol from the whisky give this a strong nose with the spirit dominant over a subtle honey base. Taste The taste is a medium sweet to medium taste. The whisky definitely lengthens the finish with a familiar alcohol burn and heat. I think I might have had it a little warm at first as chilling it slightly mellows out the spirit heat to bring through more of the honey flavours. The combination of whisky and honey is definitely a warming one (there's a reason hot toddies exist) and there are elements of butterscotch that emerge by themselves, even without adding actual butterscotch liqueur as they recommend.","tags":"Friary Liqueurs","url":"https://traditionalmead.uk/friary-mead-liqueur/","loc":"https://traditionalmead.uk/friary-mead-liqueur/"},{"title":"Friary Spiced Mead","text":"This is a metheglin (or spiced mead) from Friary Liqueurs.

Appearance The colour is every so slighty darker and more golden than Friary's traditional mead , which could be down to the spices themselves or an indication the fermentation is subtly different since the end result is 13% ABV instead of the 14% ABV for the traditional. Nose The spices lead to a more potent aroma than the pure honey mead version. The alcohol and honey flavours are dominated by a more complex bouquet of scents, but it is tricky to pick out any one spice flavour. There is certainly a suggestion of cloves as that tends to stand out even in small amounts, but I am willing to be corrected if there are no cloves in it at all! Taste The initial taste is sweet and spiced all at once, which leads to a very pleasant flavour in the mouth. The spices give it some length as they linger on the tongue after the honey base passes. I am still convinced there are some clove notes in the middle and the spices are balanced nicely with a not-too-sweet body such that no one taste overpowers the others.

It is 14% ABV and advertises on the label that it is best served chilled or slightly warm, so I guess room temperature is unacceptable. Appearance This is very light in colour compared to most meads. In fact, the colour is getting towards the that of Lindisfarne , but not quite as pale since Lindisfarne is a grape-based Pyment whereas this Friary mead is actually a mead (fermented from honey). The viscosity is lower than a lot of other meads too, which either suggest lower alcohol or a lot of the sugar has been fermented away. Given the 14% alcohol, my money is on the latter. Nose The honey aroma is gentle on this one. Not quite strong enough to stop the alcohol coming through with it, which is a good or bad thing depending on your outlook on life or how far through the week we are. Taste The taste is actually more complex and longer than I assumed from the gentleness of the aroma. There is a gentle sweetness, yes, but not overly (or sickly!) so. There is a rising heat and sharpness as the alcohol hits, which mellows out to slight dryness. Overall, I think I would describe this as a medium sweet mead rather than just \"sweet\", but the bottle does not advertise it as such. It's not a truly Dry Meads such as Dragonsbreath Baldur by any means, but the sweetness isn't as heavy as, say, Lyme Bay Traditional Mead mead.","tags":"Friary Liqueurs","url":"https://traditionalmead.uk/friary-traditional-mead/","loc":"https://traditionalmead.uk/friary-traditional-mead/"},{"title":"Garden Mint Mead","text":"A mint-flavoured mead from the English Heritage-branded range produced by Lyme Bay Winery .

This mead from their \"Hawksmead\" range is named Sleipnir after Odin's war horse (and Loki's son — now that's a story!) From their own website: From Loki we have therefore created 'son' of Loki. Tasting like treacle toffee, this is a sweet, dark mead against the savoury of Loki. Cleverly disguising it's 17% abv, it deposits a delicious and delectable hint of treacle toffee on the palate, that leaves you wanting more! Sleipnir, the son of Loki. Loki was a shape-shifter and appeared as a stallion and bred with a mare. The result was Sleipnir, an eight legged horse. Such was the speed that Sleipnir could travel that Odin, the All-father, took him as his war horse. A lot of homebrewers like to use maple syrup, molasses or treacle instead of honey. When maple syrup is fermented alone, it is known as Acerglyn . In this case, however, the ingredients seem to be a mix of raw honey and treacle, so I suppose this is still technically a mead. Appearance The colour is what you'd expect from something containing treacle. It is dark with honey colours only highlighting the meniscus of the liquid. At 17% ABV , the legs are quite noticeable if you swirl the glass around. Nose The aroma is almost exactly that of treacle toffee. There is little in terms of an overpowering alcohol scent at all. Taste Clearly, treacle toffee is a perfect flavour if you are looking to hide the alcohol in a drink. The first sip is a bold taste of liquid treacle toffee with a substantial mouth feel approaching that of a single cream (or at least whole milk). There is a small amount of heat from the alcohol in the finish only. The toffee notes hang on into the aftertaste for a very pleasing finish indeed.

Him, that made the water for every one good, Him, that made every gift, and prospers it. May Maelgwn of Mona be affected with mead, and affect us, From the foaming mead-horns, with the choicest pure liquor, Which the bees collect, and do not enjoy. Mead distilled sparkling, its praise is everywhere. The multitude of creatures which the earth nourishes, God made for man to enrich him. Some fierce, some mute, he enjoys them. Some wild, some tame, the Lord makes them. Their coverings become clothing. For food, for drink, till doom they will continue. I will implore the Ruler, sovereign of the country of peace, To liberate Elphin from banishment. The man who gave me wine and ale and mead. And the great princely steeds, beautiful their appearance, May he yet give me bounty to the end. By the will of God, he will give in honour, Five five-hundred festivals in the way of peace. Elphinian knight of mead, late be thy time of rest. Another, mediæval Welsh poem, Y Gododdin, contains the stanza: Men went to Catraeth at morn Their high spirits lessened their life-span They drank mead, gold and sweet, ensnaring; For a year the minstrels were merry. Red their swords, let the blades remain Uncleansed, white shields and four-sided spearheads, Before Mynyddog Mwynfawr's men. This poem tells how the ruler of the Gododdin, Mynyddog Mwynfawr, gathered warriors from several Brythonic kingdoms and for a year's feasting and drinking mead in his halls at Din Eidyn (now Edinburgh today) shortly before attacking Catraeth (believed to be Catterick, North Yorkshire today). There are also mentions of mead in Beowulf where Danish warriors drank mead and Mead featured as a heroic drink in both German and Celtic poetry. Tax and regulation drove commercial mead out of popularity with beer and wine being the predominant alcoholic drinks for some time. Many monasteries continued the tradition, however, since some areas of Britain are unsuitable for grapes. Perhaps the most well-known of such monasteries is Lindisfarne, after which Lindisfarne mead is still named today.","tags":"_pages","url":"https://traditionalmead.uk/history-of-mead/","loc":"https://traditionalmead.uk/history-of-mead/"},{"title":"I'M IdroMiele Italian mead","text":"This Italian mead is an interesting, lightly sparking drink fermented from a blend of three floral honeys: Acacia, Stachys and Sunflower.

The description on the bottle does not confirm if caramelisation is used in their process however (maybe someone can confirm in the comments below). Appearance The colour is a medium-light brown, but perhaps not nearly as dark as some of the treacle-based meads from The Lancashire Mead Company .

It is made by St Aiden's Winery on the Holy Island of Lindisfarne, Northumberland. This drink is technically a pyment because it is fermented from grape juice with honey added. Their claim is that this is more aligned with the approach favoured by ancient Rome. Herbs are added for additional flavour and this mead is fortified with \"neutral spirits\". The history of mead on the island of Lindisfarne supposedly goes back to mediaeval monks (see History of mead in the UK ) who inhabited the island. The current offering has been made only since 1962 however. Appearance Very pale so much as to be off-clear. It reminds of white wines from cooler regions such as Pinot Grigio. Nose The nose unmistakably yields hints of the added spirit, but without the burn from rough spirits such as vodka. Beneath there is a floral — perhaps grassy — aroma. Taste The use of grapes gives a subtle acidity underneath a medium body of sweetness. This provides a dry-sweet balance not often achieved with pure honey meads. The dryness and acidity makes the drink more refreshing for drinking by itself (as opposed to as a dessert wine as is the case for many pure honey meads).

This appears to vary from their original Lindisfarne Mead by having a hint of orange in the taste and a pink blush colour, presumably from the grape fermentation. As grapes as used — as in all their meads — this is technical a Pyment . The copy on the bottle promotes the pink blush colour as \"the delicate colour of blushing romance\" and they are suggesting this drink for occasions such as wedding receptions and garden parties. Appearance This Pyment is almost the exact colour of a rosé blush wine. Given grapes are the base fermentable in a Pyment , it is likely it has been made just like a rosé wine before being sweetened with honey. Nose The orange aroma is the first to leap out of the glass with some of the spirits clearly notable in the bouquet. There are some floral notes reminiscent of spring blossom. Taste There is an orange blossom flavour at the front on first taste. Some of the honey \"mead\" characteristics make up with aftertaste with some hints of spirit. There are perfume notes in amongst the floral which are either added artificially or come from the use of an aromatic grape. The flavour is fairly intense overall so this drink is better served chilled. Mixing One thing we tried to mute the floral intensity is to mix this pink mead with an equal amount of dry prosecco. This worked quite well to produce a chilled, refreshing, floral drink with a nice balance of sweet and dry.

From their own website: Proudly announcing our brand new Lindisfarne Spiced Mead! Our first new mead in nearly half a century, it blends carefully chosen spices with our already famous mead to produce a delicious seasonal taste. A spiced mead is a good additional to any Christmas. It works well as both a post-dinner dessert wine or warmed to be drunk like a mulled wine as the nights get shorter. The comparison to Lyme Bay Christmas Mead mead is hard to avoid. Appearance This is still rather light in colour, which is likely an effect of this being being a Pyment made from fermenting grape juice. There are more orange hues than the classic Lindisfarne Mead though. Nose The aroma reminds quite vividly of gingerbread and lebkuchen. This follows natrally from a blend of spices inseperable from associations with Christmas. Taste The grape base yields some dryness and acidity, albeit only subtly. This leads to a refreshing \"session\" mead. The spices are notable, but perhaps more strongly so in the aroma. In the taste, the spices sit nicely within the body of the drink for a refreshing drink perfect for winter months.

Lyme Bay Winery 's Christmas mead is arguably their star offering. This mead is technically a Metheglin (Spiced Mead) with its rich spice flavourings of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, lemon and orange zest. These are all spices and flavourings associated with Christmas (and are common in mulled wines), so the result is indeed a mead drink that tastes like Christmas in liquid form. Lyme Bay Winery 's Christmas mead was awarded a two star \"Great Taste\" gold award in 2014. Colour This is lighter in colour than the Lyme Bay Traditional Mead also sold by Lyme Bay Winery . There are hints of orange hues in an otherwise golden drink. There is a noteworthy viscosity (and legs!) despite the lower alcohol at 10%. Nose All the Christmas flavours promised on the label come together to make a whole greater than the parts, with individual notes hard to list. The honey aroma still comes through to suggest the spices and flavours are balanced with the original mead body. Taste The honey sweetness and citrus are the first flavours to hit you in the initial taste. This leads to a comforting honey and lemon taste so common in hot toddies, cold medicines, etc. The spices are subtle and add a not-too-overpowering complexity to the finish. The length is therefore longer than you get with most meads, in particular for such a light, (relatively) low alcohol style.

Where to buy homebrew mead kits Traditional Mead Honey Wine Making Kit Starter Mead Making Kit Ingredients Honey (1.4kg or 3lb) — Use real, natural honey for the best results. Distilled water (1 gallon or 3.8l) Yeast Any other flavourings such as fruit or spices Preparation Fully sterlise any equipment as the fermentation process is favourable to growth of bacteria and other microorganisms too. Many of the kits listed above come with a sterilising solution or powder. Make up \"must\" mixture for your mead First you need to liquify your honey (preferably using a warm water bath) and then mix it with the distilled water. There is no need to heat or boil this mixture. You now have what is known as \"must\" (the same term used in wine making). At this point you can optionally mix in fruits or spices to add some unique flavour to your mead. Now you can add the yeast to your must. Some yeasts require some rehydration first, so check the label for any instructions. Store and ferment your mead Place in a fermantation bucket or any other large, sterilised container. You want to ensure the following: The container should not beoverly full — leave room for a lively fermentation! You need to stop air getting in, while still allowing carbon dioxide to escape. Many of the kits listed above come with a proper airlock, but a you can get away with poking holes in a balloon and stretching over the top of the container (secure with tape or an elastic band). Leave the mead fermenting in a location that keeps it at the right temperature. Check the label for your yeast to see if any particular temperature is recommended. Check the gravity Specific gravity ( SG ) is the density of your must at any time. You can get the original gravity ( OG ) by measuring with a hydrometer. Pure water has an SG of exactly 1, so your mixture is going to be something like 1.100 (each 1lb of honey seems to add 0.035 of gravity). SG is expected to go down (attentuate) during the fermentation process as the yeast converts the sugars into alcohol. You can predict what the final gravity ( FG ) will be by predicting how much sugar your yeast will convert into alcohol. First we can use a simple formula that estimates the ABV of your fermented drink: (OG - FG) x 131 = ABV That is, if your original gravity is 1.100 and then you measure the final gravity after fermentation stops to get 1.005, then you can plug OG and FG into the formula above to get: (1.100 - 1.005) x 131 = (0.095) x 131 = 12.4% Your yeast should have a known alcohol tolerance. For example, Lalvin EC -1118 is a popular Champagne yeast that is good for making a strong mead and its rated tolerance is 18%. If we use that tolerance as an estimate for what our final ABV will be, we can use the formula above in reverse: OG - (ABV / 131) = FG And then plug in 18% as our estimated final ABV along with an example original gravity of 1.150 (this example is higher as more honey is needed for such a strong mead): FG = 1.150 - (18 / 131) = 1.150 - 0.138 = 1.012 Note that if the original gravity had been 0.100 as per our first example, the formula would suggest a FG below 1, which is impossible! In that case, it's telling us that the yeast would ferment all the sugar out of the must and the final mead will be quite dry. If you want to retain some sweetness to your final mead, choose an ABV for the formula 1% or so above what the yeast can manage. So we might make a must with an original gravity that would create an ABV of 19% or 20% for a yeast with a tolerance of 18%. This ensures that fermentation stops before all the sugar turns into alcohol. Aerate for the first sugar break Once we know the estimated, final gravity ( FG ), we can get the attenuation from the simple different of OG and FG , e.g. Attenuation = OG - FG = 1.100 - 1.005 = 0.095 If we divide that number into thirds (e.g. 0.032), then our first sugar break is at: 1.100 - 0.032 = 1.068 In our example here, the yeast needs aerating (i.e. allow oxygen in) while the specific gravity is between 1.100 and 1.068. Ensure that you aerate daily for that first third of gravity attenuation, maybe more than once a day if you can. Wait You will need to ferment for probably at leaast 8 weeks. You can bottle after that time if you wish, but there's a few more nuanced things to look out for if you want to be more precise. A simple sign that fermentation has stopped is when the bubbling has stopped. If you are using an air lock and see no bubble for 3 weeks, then you're good to go. Another sign is that there is no change in your specific gravity for several days. Image titled Make Mead Step 66 There are a few different ways to know when the mead is done fermenting:[2] The most accurate way to know is to measure the specific gravity with a hydrometer when you first mix it, then measure it every two weeks. The chosen yeast has a published ABV tolerance, and the hydrometer reading can be used to determine what the final gravity of the mead should be. When the mead reaches this gravity, wait a minimum of 4-6 months before bottling to ensure all CO2 that was in suspension in the mead has degassed. If the mead has not properly degassed and too much CO2 for the rating of the type of bottle the mead is bottled in is transferred, there is a risk of bottle explosion with temperature swings. Wait at least 8 weeks. The amount of time it takes for the mead to ferment will depend on a variety of factors, but 8 weeks should be enough time for most scenarios. If you're using an airlock, wait until 3 weeks after it stops bubbling. Age your mead Transfer your fermented must to a large container such as a demijohn to store for aging. Make sure there is no space for air if possible. We want to minimise the amount of mead touching the air. The longer you spend aging the mead, the better. You will probably want to leave this for a good 6 to 8 months, but some advice on other sites advocates bottling after 2-3 months! Bottle it! Transfer the mead into bottles, seal, and store in a cool dark place. Open and enjoy when you feel the need for mead.","tags":"_pages","url":"https://traditionalmead.uk/making-mead/","loc":"https://traditionalmead.uk/making-mead/"},{"title":"Mead Liqueurs","text":"There is certainly a lot of variety under the \"mead\" banner these days. While strictly, there are different Types of Mead , the term mead seems to have been accepted for a broad range of drinks derived from honey. Traditional mead was typically brewed to wine strength, which follows naturally from the high sugar content in honey and the usage of yeasts popular in wine making. However, the rise in popularity of mead has brought much creativity to the industry and given us a lot more choice. In one direction, there is the rise in beer-strength \"craft mead\" that can typically be in the region of 5% ABV . This makes it more of a session \"pub\" drink. Then in the other direction, there are of course stronger liqueurs derived from mead or honey too. In our list below, we have tried any we find that specifically put \"mead\" in the name. This might include simple liqueurs that are flavoured with honey but also liqueur-strength drinks that are truly derived from a mead recipe.

This is distinct from a mead actually made spicy using chillies, which would be a capsicumel. Metheglin has its origins in folk medicines. The Welsh for mead is medd and meddyglyn came from a combination of meddyg (healing/medicine) and _llyn (liquor). This gives rise to the English word Metheglin today. Today, it is far more common to find metheglins brewed with sweet spices rather than herbs as the combination of honey and spice produced a very warming drink. Many spiced meads or metheglins are incredibly popular around Winter and Christmas time served heated as an alternative to mulled wine. We can highly recommend it if you haven't tried it! Due to this common pairing of Christmas and sweet spices, it may be no surprise that many Producers have a \"Christmas mead\" in their offerings. See our page specifically on Christmas meads for a full list, but the most well-known is probably Lyme Bay Christmas Mead . Friary Liqueurs produce a different, but equally enjoyable Christmas mead which might be a sensible purchase if you are ordering in a variety of liqueurs at the same time for the festive season. Of course, any metheglin packed with sweet spice flavours is going to be a delightfully warming tipple in the Winter months, so feel free to try any of the delicious metheglins we have found so far below.","tags":"_categories","url":"https://traditionalmead.uk/metheglin-spiced-mead/","loc":"https://traditionalmead.uk/metheglin-spiced-mead/"},{"title":"Modern Mead Co.

It's an excellent example of the darker pure mead style with additional notes of caramel, maybe even slightly burnt. It's created by Highlands winery which is based in what used to be a sixteenth Century castle, Moniack Castle, in Invernessshire. Since the winery is now fully owned by Lyme Bay Winery , it is tempting to mark this as an English mead as well as a Scottish mead . We've kept it as just Scottish for now given its history, but feel free to discuss this in the comments! I first encounted this mead at a \"Highland Village\" component of the Christmas markets in Edinburgh. The German side of the markets closed up by Christmas Day, but the Highland side stayed open right up until midnight on Hogmanay. It was served warmed and this is a drink that does well served warm in the Winter. Appearance The colour is a deep burnt orange colour hinting at caramel in the taste. There are strong legs on the glass from the relatively strong 14.6% ABV . Despite the robust colour, there is a pleasant translucency as the light shines through. Nose The nose is slightly floral with a robust body of caramel aroma. a powerful nose is something that may be lacking in a number of the lighter mead styles. Taste It is positively sweet on the palate, however the caramel body carries it well to a balanced, warming mead drink.

Today's mead is their apricot flavour. Apricot is a flavour that naturally emerges in some of the more complex wine grapes such as Chardonnay and Viognier, so it's not too much of a stretch to see an apricot mead pair with savoury foods. Moroccan cuisine commonly uses apricots and sweeter wines generally pair well with spicy, Middle Eastern foods. It's possible to match apricot melomel well with Indian food as well, but other fruits such as mango might be a stronger match (in place of mango lassi which is common in Indian restaurants in the UK ). A mead flavoured with fruit is technically known as a melomel . Appearance This mead (melomel) is a little deeper in colour than the \"pure\" honey mead . It has more orange hues presumably taken from the apricot fruit itself. Nose There is a bold bouquet as with the pure mead. The apricot flavours are pronounced. Taste The first taste is a strong, sweet one that carries the apricot well. The acidity seems lower than the pure mead, but that be an effect of the apricot flavour given the fruit is almost certainly more acidic than the honey, if anything.

Cheese is acidic and salty, but on many occasions I have paired baked Camembert with blackberries, so I might be tempted to ignore the advice and pull this mead out next time I serve it. Appearance There is a deep, tawny colour in the body. It is a little lighter than the raspberry version , but quite similar otherwise. Nose The aroma is more subtle than the raspberry and apricot meads. Unsurprisingly, the nose is mainly blackberry notes with even the alcohol seeming quite muted. Taste The initial taste is a gentle balance of tartness and sweetness. The honey and alcohol provide a pleasing tingle that leads into a slight dryness for the finish.

Raspberry and white chocolate are a classic pairing in many desserts and baked goods, so it stands to reason we might pair raspberry mead with a white chocolate cheesecake or other similar desserts.

Nose The raspberry aroma is immediately notable simply upon opening the bottle. Closer to the glass, there are bolder notes from the alcohol and the honey. Taste The raspberry flavour suggests similarities with raspberry jam, but the initial taste is actually a little more tart and complex. The comparisons to jam are not totally unwarranted as there is the expected blend of raspberry and sweetness. Some of the complexity might come from the honey base, which is certainly evident in the finish.

There is a distinctiveness in the honey aromas and a sharpness balancing out the sweetness. Taste The taste is definitely not a sweet one and more in the medium category. There is a nice honey flavour in the initial sip, but the taste isn't very long or complex afterwards. The body feels like thin, which makes it quaffable if medium-sweet is your thing, but it does not put in the category of warming, winter meads.

The warming sensation of the ginger might make this a good mead for the Autumn and Winter months. Appearance The colour is somewhat orange, but with a clarity that allows the light to shine through. Nose The ginger is subtle in the aroma. Some robust honey notes stand strong. A bit of a swirl around the glass does liven up the ginger though. Taste I'm normally not as keen on any drink that overdoes the ginger flavouring as it makes a drink difficult to finish. Normally, I opt for things that have a subtle hint of the spice and this mead is somewhere in between the extremes. The initial taste hits with a robust taste from the honey that mellows out to a strong ginger spice on the finish.

We managed to get hold of some flavours, one of which is this \"Lavender Mead\". The notes on the bottle say that this mead is made with dried lavender to give a sweet mead with floral notes. The Rookery is based on Perthshire and claims to use only honey in their fermentation — never sugars or syrups. They also claim to use hand-foraged ingredients when making flavoured meads, so perhaps this is hand-foraged lavender in this case. Appearance A golden yellow somewhere right in the middle of the spectrum between a darker mead such as Lyme Bay Traditional Mead and a pale Pyment like Lindisfarne Mead . Nose I could smell this one just as I poured it! The lavender bursts out of the bottle into the surrounding air without pause. On a closer nose, there are subtle notes of sweetness, but it's hard to deny that the lavender dominates the bouquet. Taste Unsurprisingly, the lavender is the strongest component of the taste. There still manages however to be an undertone of mead body to carry that floral bouquet. The taste was a challenge for me as I had to make a conscious effort to separate the lavender scent from associations of soap and other bathroom products. That association is not warranted as there is nothing \"soapy\" about the mead, but perhaps lavender is just such an unusual taste to find in a mead and my palate is confused. After a few sips, it grows as a perfectly pleasant drink similar to any other of the more floral fruit wines (such as elderflower). Definitely a unique experience overall. I can say for sure that such a strong taste masks well the supposed 17% alcohol strength!","tags":"The Rookery","url":"https://traditionalmead.uk/rookery-lavender-mead/","loc":"https://traditionalmead.uk/rookery-lavender-mead/"},{"title":"The Rookery Mead","text":"The pure honey , non-flavoured mead from The Rookery .

Many are fermented with fruits and spices for additional flavours. The last decade or so has seen a resurgence in popularity in the UK as well as other countries such as the United States.

Whether warm or chilled, this is a lively Cyser (honey cider or mead with apples). This comes from the Manchester-based Zymurgorium \"craft\" meadery, distillery, brewery and cidery. This is definitely a brew out of the recent wave of \"craft\" brewers. The bottle design, copy and graphics all give an air of hipsterism. In their own words: Being Able To Make Great Cider Means Having Great Responsibility As It Has To Be Refreshing, Flavoursome & Delicate All In One Glorious Sip. In This Cider We Have Cranked Up The Gradient Of satisfaction By Using Cloudy Unfiltered Pressed Apple Juice and The Wonder Sugar That is honey. The World's only non-man made glucose syrup Makes This Cider Sunshine in A Bottle! The alcoholic strength comes in at 5.5%, which is reasonable for a cider. Appearance The drink is cloudy and unfiltered like many cloudy ciders. The fizz is incredibly lively to be more akin to a Champagne than a sparkling cider. Nose This one is quite timid on the nose. There are subtle hints of the pressed apple juice, but nothing too notable. Taste There is a definite apple and scrumpy-style cider taste, but it is mellowed and less \"punchy\" than many scrumpy ciders. It's not so much a taste of honey that is mellowing the apple taste, but more a crisp dryness which would suggest a lot of the sugar is fermented away. Where to buy Seems to be no longer available.","tags":"Zymurgorium","url":"https://traditionalmead.uk/zymurgorium-cyser-craft-cider/","loc":"https://traditionalmead.uk/zymurgorium-cyser-craft-cider/"},{"title":"Zymurgorium Superior Craft Mead","text":"The highlight for me with all Zymurgorium meads is the rather unique descriptions on the back of the bottles. The description for their pure honey \"craft\" mead is no different. In their own words: THE ORIGINAL GODFATHER OF ALL BREWS… So we as humans have been living alongside alcoholic beverages for like forever, so imagine your great great great…(10,000 years)… great Grandad this is what he was sitting by the fire with talking about how long a day he had had wrestling mammoth with his pointy-stick! This Is the original Godfather that shook the world and it only took 10,000 years to perfect in our awesome meadery! If all things retro are cool then this is the bottom of the thermometer! Appearance Clearer than than most meads — closer to an off-dry white wine in terms of colour. The drink is sparkling , but the fizz is very subtle. Nose A subtle nose of honey. There isn't a strong aroma. It's worth noting that a typical beer/cider strength of 5.5% ABV means that this drink is not overpowered with alcohol as you would get with meads made in line with wines. Taste A pleasant semi-sweet drink. The dryness allows more of the honey taste itself to come through without the sugar masking it. The fizz is subtle enough not to be noticed, but definitely adds to the mouthfeel and taste.","tags":"Zymurgorium","url":"https://traditionalmead.uk/zymurgorium-superior-craft-mead/","loc":"https://traditionalmead.uk/zymurgorium-superior-craft-mead/"},{"title":"Zymurgorium","text":"Zymurgorium is a meadery, gin distilery based in Greater Manchester. It was founded by Aaron Darke, who calls himself \"Zymurgorium Proprietor and Big Cheese\". He claims to have got the idea after brewing a lot for people at university and that he forages for his ingredients himself. The meadery takes its name from Zymurgy — the branch of chemistry concerned with brewing and fermentation — and Emporium . In addition to mead, they make a substantial number of other drinks: Zymurgorium Extra Io's Footsteps Sweet Violet Gin Liqueur The Original Marmalade-of-Manchester Gin Zymurgorium Quince & Jamaican Ginger Gin Liqueur The Original Manchester Gin Zymurgorium Strawberry & A Trio Of Mint Gin Liqueur Zymurgorium Extra Gooseberry Gin Liqueur The Original Manchester Absinthe Zymurgorium Pink Grapefruit Gin Liqueur Zymurgorium Extra Rhubarb & Cranberry Gin Liqueur The Original Manchester Vodka The Original Manchester Sloe Gin Zymurgorium Superior Sweet Mead Zymurgorium & Northern Monk Cahokia Zymurgorium Turkish Delight Gin Liqueur Zymurgorium Crème of Hebridean Raspberry Zymurgorium Mandarin Dynasty Gin 42.5% Zymurgorium & Northern Monk Infirmarian So, Manchester's \"first and presently only craft distillery\" is worth a try as the meads they produce are very interesting in character and they explore flavours you don't tend to find in other meads.
