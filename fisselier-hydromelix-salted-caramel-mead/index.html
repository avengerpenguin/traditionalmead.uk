    <p><img alt="" src="https://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B017SLEWCA&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=GB&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=traditionalmead-21"></p>
<p>Salted caramel is a very popular flavour in almost anything these
days, so it was inevitable that we would eventually see a salted
caramel&nbsp;mead.</p>
<p>This mead is another <a href="/chouchen/">Chouchen</a> in the Hydromelix range
from the Brittany-based producer <a href="/liqueurs-fisselier/">Liqueurs&nbsp;Fisselier</a>.</p>
<p>It is suggested to have these meads as an aperitif before dinner, but
this flavour is likely better as a dessert wine to accompany rich
desserts such as cheesecakes. Such a strong, sweet taste is likely to
be too intense as a pre-dinner&nbsp;drink.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this mead has taken the caramel colour from its
flavouring. It has a deep orange-brown translucency and a nice&nbsp;clarity.</p>
<h2 id="nose">Nose</h2>
<p>Notes of caramel and confectionery are immediately obvious on the nose
and it is not a subtle flavour. There is honey in the bouquet as well,
but it takes a back seat to the&nbsp;flavouring.</p>
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>
<p>The initial sip brings all the confectionery as promised by the
aroma. There is a little bit of body and chewiness from the caramel,
but not overly&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>The length of the flavour is surprising, however, with a the alcohol
and a little bit of tartness coming in for the aftertaste. It is
certainly more complex than you might&nbsp;expect.</p>
<p>It is perhaps a little sickly sweet at room temperature, so do consider
chilling as a dessert wine with rich&nbsp;desserts.</p>
