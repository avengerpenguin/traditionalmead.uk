<p>This is a <a href="/metheglin-spiced-mead/">metheglin (or spiced mead)</a> from
Friary Liqueurs. There is no indication on the bottle as to which
spices they are and their website just says &#8220;selected spices&#8221;, so I
guess the mystery is half the&nbsp;fun!</p>
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>The colour is every so slighty darker and more golden
than <a href="/friary-traditional-mead/">Friary&#8217;s traditional mead</a>, which
could be down to the spices themselves or an indication the
fermentation is subtly different since the end result is 13% <span class="caps">ABV</span>
instead of the 14% <span class="caps">ABV</span> for the&nbsp;traditional.</p>
<h2 id="nose">Nose</h2>
<p>The spices lead to a more potent aroma than the pure honey mead
version. The alcohol and honey flavours are dominated by a more
complex bouquet of scents, but it is tricky to pick out any one spice
flavour. There is certainly a suggestion of cloves as that tends to
stand out even in small amounts, but I am willing to be corrected if
there are no cloves in it at&nbsp;all!</p>
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>
<p>The initial taste is sweet and spiced all at once, which leads to a
very pleasant flavour in the mouth. The spices give it some length as
they linger on the tongue after the honey base&nbsp;passes.</p>
<p>I am still convinced there are some clove notes in the middle and the
spices are balanced nicely with a not-too-sweet body such that no one
taste overpowers the&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Overall, I really like this one and it&#8217;s moreish enough to keep
drinking it by&nbsp;itself.</p>
