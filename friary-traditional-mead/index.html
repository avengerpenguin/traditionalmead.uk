    <p><img alt="Bottle of Friary Traditional Mead" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0927/4856/products/Friary-Liqueurs-Whisky-Mead_2048x2048.jpg?v=1437393948"></p>
<p>This is the pure honey, &#8220;traditional&#8221; mead offering
from <a href="/friary-liqueurs/">Friary Liqueurs</a>. It is 14% <span class="caps">ABV</span> and
advertises on the label that it is best served chilled or slightly
warm, so I guess room temperature is&nbsp;unacceptable.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>This is very light in colour compared to most meads. In fact, the
colour is getting towards the that of <a href="/lindisfarne/">Lindisfarne</a>, but not quite as pale since <a href="/lindisfarne/">Lindisfarne</a> is a grape-based <a href="/pyment/">Pyment</a> whereas this Friary mead is actually a mead (fermented from&nbsp;honey).</p>
<p>The viscosity is lower than a lot of other meads too, which either
suggest lower alcohol or a lot of the sugar has been fermented
away. Given the 14% alcohol, my money is on the&nbsp;latter.</p>
<h2 id="nose">Nose</h2>
<p>The honey aroma is gentle on this one. Not quite strong enough to stop the alcohol coming through with it, which is a good or bad thing
depending on your outlook on life or how far through the week we&nbsp;are.</p>
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>
<p>The taste is actually more complex and longer than I assumed from the
gentleness of the aroma. There is a gentle sweetness, yes, but not
overly (or sickly!) so. There is a rising heat and sharpness as the
alcohol hits, which mellows out to slight&nbsp;dryness.</p>
<p>Overall, I think I would describe this as a medium sweet mead rather
than just &#8220;sweet&#8221;, but the bottle does not advertise it as such. It&#8217;s
not a truly <a href="/dry-meads/">Dry Meads</a> such as <a href="/dragonsbreath-baldur/">Dragonsbreath Baldur</a> by any means, but the sweetness isn&#8217;t as heavy as, say, <a href="/lyme-bay-traditional-mead/">Lyme Bay Traditional Mead</a>&nbsp;mead.</p>
