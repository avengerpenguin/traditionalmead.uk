<p>This is a dry style offered by <a href="/the-lancashire-mead-company/">The Lancashire Mead Company</a> from their &#8220;Dragonsbreath Artisan Mead&#8221; range. <a href="/wildflower-honey/">Wildflower Honey</a> is used more sparingly to leave less sugar behind at the end of the fermentation. This produces a dry mead ideal for those who find some other meads overly&nbsp;sweet.</p>
<p>From their own&nbsp;website:</p>
<pre><code>This is the first ferment from our very own yeast strain and shows the delicate intricacies of the honey it was derived from, giving this mead a very busy flavour, yet pleasant, sensation.
</code></pre>
<p>A dry mead is an interesting experience as the dryness is arguably bringing out the fundamental, base qualities of the original honey. A sweet honey is always going to appeal with its high sugar content, but there is a quality to honey that distinguishes it from pure sugar &#8212; it is that quality we experience in concentrated form when we ferment (almost) all the sugar&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>This mead appears to be pure honey with nothing else added, which is quite simple for a meadery that has a wide range of interesting ingredients (orange, tea, molasses, <a href="/treacle/">Treacle</a> &#8212; see others by
<a href="/the-lancashire-mead-company/">The Lancashire Mead&nbsp;Company</a>.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>The colour is a deep honey colour &#8212; somewhere between yellow and orange. A lot of meads come out much lighter than this. A medium-dark appearance hints at a deeper flavour,&nbsp;perhaps.</p>
<h2 id="nose">Nose</h2>
<p>The aroma is remarkably floral, with slight medicinal qualities on first opening. A bit of air mellows out any mild astringency&nbsp;however.</p>
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>
<p>The taste is definitely dry as promised by the label. There is a medium body of wildflower flavour on the initial sip and it leads into a very long, dry finish that lingers for some&nbsp;time.</p>
