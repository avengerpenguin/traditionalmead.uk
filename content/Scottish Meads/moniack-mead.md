Moniack Mead is one of our absolute favourites. It's a great example of the
darker style with more notes of caramel, perhaps even a little burnt. It is
produced by Highlands Winery which is based in what used to be a 16th Century
castle, Moniack Castle, in Invernessshire.

## Nose

The nose is slightly floral with a strong body of caramel aroma. A strong 
nose is something that can be lacking in some of the lighter mead styles.

## Taste

It is definitely sweet on the palate, but the caramel body carries it well 
to a balanced, warming mead drink.

## Food pairing

Our personal favourite pairing for a strong, Scottish mead is of course as a
dessert wine with our cranachan at the end of a Burns Supper!
