This is a lightly spiced mead from the Cwm Deri vineyard in Pembrokeshire, 
Wales.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Colour

This mead has an appealing pale yellow, but not too straw-like colour.

## Nose

There is a strong aroma of honey itself, not far off the aroma of raw honey.

## Taste

The initial taste is that of pure, liquid honey. THe medium body only adds 
to the sentation that you are drinking a liquid form of honey. There are 
subtle spice undertones that are hard to pinpoint and there is a slight 
dryness to the finish that adds some complexity.
