This mead is strictly a cyser as it is made with Welsh apples and has a 
typical cider alcoholic strength of 5.5%.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Colour

This drink has a cloudy, sunset colour typical of any West Country cider. IT
is a sparking drink but the fizz settles very quickly after pouring.

## Nose

The aroma isn't strong but what aroma there is reminds more of a cider with 
perhaps a very subtle hint of the honey, if anything.

## Taste

The taste is low on body and with a very dry finish. It is very much the 
taste of a dry scrumpy cider with only subtle overtones left from the honey.
It is perhaps something interesting to try if you are a fan of dry cider.
