I was greeted with a virtual geyser of fizz on opening this one. Whether warm
or chilled, this is a lively [cyser](/types-of-mead/) (honey cider or mead
with apples). This comes from the Manchester-based
[Zymurgorium](/zymurgorium/) "craft" meadery, distillery, brewery and
cidery.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

This is definitely a brew out of the recent wave of "craft" brewers. The
bottle design, copy and graphics all give an air of hipsterism.

In their own words:

    Being Able To Make Great Cider Means Having Great Responsibility As It Has To Be Refreshing, Flavoursome & Delicate All In One Glorious Sip. In This Cider We Have Cranked Up The Gradient Of satisfaction By Using Cloudy Unfiltered Pressed Apple Juice and The Wonder Sugar That is honey. The Worldâ€™s only non-man made glucose syrup Makes This Cider Sunshine in A Bottle!

The alcoholic strength comes in at 5.5%, which is reasonable for a cider.

## Appearance

The drink is cloudy and unfiltered like many cloudy ciders. The fizz is
incredibly lively to be more akin to a Champagne than a sparkling cider.

## Nose

This one is quite timid on the nose. There are subtle hints of the pressed
apple juice, but nothing too notable.

## Taste

There is a definite apple and scrumpy-style cider taste, but it is mellowed
and less "punchy" than many scrumpy ciders. It's not so much a taste of honey
that is mellowing the apple taste, but more a crisp dryness which would suggest
a lot of the sugar is fermented away.
