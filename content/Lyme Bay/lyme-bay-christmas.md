This is an annual staple for us, with an order placed before every
Christmas for the best part of a decade. [Lyme Bay's](/lyme-bay-winery/) Christmas mead is
arguably their star offering.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

This mead is technically a [metheglin](/metheglin/) with its rich
spice flavourings of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, lemon and
orange zest. These are all spices and flavourings associated with
Christmas (and are common in mulled wines), so the result is indeed a
mead drink that tastes like Christmas in liquid form.

Lyme Bay Winery's Christmas mead was awarded a two star "Great Taste"
gold award in 2014.

## Colour

This is lighter in colour than
the [traditional mead](/lyme-bay-traditional/) also sold by Lyme Bay
Winery. There are hints of orange hues in an otherwise golden
drink. There is a noteworthy viscosity (and legs!) despite the lower
alcohol at 10%.

## Nose

All the Christmas flavours promised on the label come together to make
a whole greater than the parts, with individual notes hard to
list. The honey aroma still comes through to suggest the spices and
flavours are balanced with the original mead body.

## Taste

The honey sweetness and citrus are the first flavours to hit you in
the initial taste. This leads to a comforting honey and lemon taste so
common in hot toddies, cold medicines, etc. The spices are subtle and
add a not-too-overpowering complexity to the finish. The length is
therefore longer than you get with most meads, in particular for such
a light, (relatively) low alcohol style.
