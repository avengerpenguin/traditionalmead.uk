Highlands Winery were based in what used to be a 16th Century
castle -- Moniack Castle -- in Invernessshire. Moniack castle was the
ancestral home of Mrs Phillipa Fraser who converted the domestic part of
the castle into a Winery and started making a range
of white and red wines then country wines.

The winery is now fully owned by [Lyme Bay Winery](/lyme-bay-winery/) and
there is no evidence that mead production is taking place in Moniack castle
any more.
