Moniack Mead is one of our absolute favourites. Itâ€™s an excellent example of
the darker pure mead style with additional notes of caramel, maybe even slightly burnt.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

It's created by Highlands winery which is based in what used to be a sixteenth
Century castle, Moniack Castle, in Invernessshire.

Since the winery is now fully owned by [Lyme Bay Winery](/lyme-bay-winery/), it
is tempting to mark this as an [English mead](/english-meads/) as well as a
[Scottish mead](/scottish-meads/). We've kept it as just Scottish for now given
its history, but feel free to discuss this in the comments!

I first encounted this mead at a "Highland Village" component of the Christmas
markets in Edinburgh. The German side of the markets closed up by Christmas Day,
but the Highland side stayed open right up until midnight on Hogmanay. It was
served warmed and this is a drink that does well served warm in the Winter.

## Appearance

The colour is a deep burnt orange colour hinting at caramel in the taste. There
are strong legs on the glass from the relatively strong 14.6% ABV. Despite the
robust colour, there is a pleasant translucency as the light shines through.

## Nose

The nose is slightly floral with a robust body of caramel aroma. a powerful
nose is something that may be lacking in a number of the lighter mead styles.

## Taste

It is positively sweet on the palate, however the caramel body carries it well
to a balanced, warming mead drink.

## Food pairing

Our personal favourite pairing for a robust, Scottish mead is of course as a
dessert wine with cranachan at the end of a Burns Supper!
