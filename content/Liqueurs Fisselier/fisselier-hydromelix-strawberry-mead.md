A strawberry mead offering from
[Liqueurs Fisselier](/liqueurs-fisselier/), a prolific producer of traditional
"Chouchen" (mead from Brittany).

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Strawberry is a fairly common fruit flavouring for meads. It's a fantastic
Summer flavour and pairs nicely with desserts and even salads.

## Appearance

The colour is a deep red taken directly from the strawberries.

## Nose

A huge bouquet of strawberrie aroma hits the nose before you're anywhere near
the glass! The aroma's intensity hints that the very essence of strawberry
flavour is condensed into this drink.

## Taste

Some tartness, sourness and alcohol stands out on the first taste. A
well-balanced body of strawberry flavour and sweetness quickly follows and the
finish is surprisingly complex with the fruit sweetness carried by a small
amount of dryness. With the aroma, I would have assumed this to be sweet like
a modern flavoured cider, but it's definteily a much more interesting drink.
