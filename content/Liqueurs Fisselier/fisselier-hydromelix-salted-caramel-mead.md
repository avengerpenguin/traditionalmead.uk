Salted caramel is a very popular flavour in almost anything these
days, so it was inevitable that we would eventually see a salted
caramel mead.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

This mead is another ["Chouchen"](/chouchen/) in the Hydromelix range
from the [Breton](/breton-meads/)-based
producer [Liqueurs Fisselier](/liqueurs-fisselier/).

It is suggested to have these meads as an aperitif before dinner, but
this flavour is likely better as a dessert wine to accompany rich
desserts such as cheesecakes. Such a strong, sweet taste is likely to
be too intense as a pre-dinner drink.

## Appearance

Unsurprisingly, this mead has taken the caramel colour form its
flavouring. It has a deep orange-brown translucency and a nice
clarity.

## Nose

Notes of caramel and confectionery are immediately obvious on the nose
and it is not a subtle flavour. There is honey in the bouquet as well,
but it takes a back seat to the flavouring.

## Taste

The initial sip brings all the confectionery as promised by the
aroma. There is a little bit of body and chewiness from the caramel,
but not overly so.

The length of the flavour is surprising, however, with a the alcohol
and a little bit of tartness coming in for the aftertaste. It is
certainly more complex than you might expect.
