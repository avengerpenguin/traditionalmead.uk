Another [metheglin (or spiced mead)](/metheglin-spiced-mead/) from
Friary Liqueurs with a Christmas theme. This one is not listed on
Friary's own website, so either I'm getting hold of rare stock or this
one is no longer produced.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Let me know in the comments if you know if they are still making this!

## Appearance

It's subtle, but I think this is slightly darker and more golden than
the [spiced mead they make](/friary-spiced-mead/). The viscosity is
still not the highest, so I'm expecting a reasonable amount of sugar
is fermented away as with
the [traditional mead](/friary-traditional-mead/).

## Nose

The aroma seems less intense than their spiced mead and perhaps more
rounded and fruitier. The honey base is more pronounced and forms part
of the bouquet rather than being masked by the spice flavours.

## Taste

The initial sip brings a bigger hit of spice than the other spiced
offering. There is a little sourness or citrus-style zest in the
middle, which hints that maybe they have flavoured it as such as is
the case with [Lyme Bay's Christmas mead](/lyme-bay-christmas/).

The honey base packs more of a punch in the middle and the taste is
shorter, again comparing it to their other metheglin. It's still a
very pleasant taste and I think well set up to pair with Christmas
desserts.
