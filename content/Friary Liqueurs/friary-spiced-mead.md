This is [metheglin (or spiced mead)](/metheglin-spiced-mead/) from
Friary Liqueurs. There is no indication on the bottle as to which
spices they are and their website just says "selected spices", so I
guess the mystery is half the fun!

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Appearance

The colour is every so slighty darker and more golden
than [Friary's traditional mead](/friary-traditional-mead/), which
could be down to the spices themselves or an indication the
fermentation is subtly different since the end result is 13% ABV
instead of the 14% ABV for the traditional.

## Nose

The spices lead to a more potent aroma than the pure honey mead
version. The alcohol and honey flavours are dominated by a more
complex bouquet of scents, but it is tricky to pick out any one spice
flavour. There is certainly a suggestion of cloves as that tends to
stand out even in small amounts, but I am willing to be corrected if
there are no cloves in it at all!

## Taste

The initial taste is sweet and spiced all at once, which leads to a
very pleasant flavour in the mouth. The spices give it some length as
they linger on the tongue after the honey base passes.

I am still convinced there are some clove notes in the middle and the
spices are balanced nicely with a not-too-sweet body such that no one
taste overpowers the others.

Overall, I really like this one and it's moreish enough to keep
drinking it by itself.
