Friary Liqueurs make an interesting mead liqueur in their "classic
collection". It is blended with a 3 year old blended Scottish whisky
and weighs in at 18% ABV.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Their recommended recipe is a cocktail blending this liqueur stirred
with a dash of their butterscotch liqueur. I've not tried it, but let
me know in the comments if you do!

## Appearance

The colour is a light golden colour with some good legs on the glass
from the 18% ABV. I think the body looks thinner than I imagined given
I was expecting similarities with Drambuie, but Friary seem to keep
their mead drinks from being overly sweet.

## Nose

The alcohol from the whisky give this a strong nose with the spirit
dominant over a subtle honey base.

## Taste

The taste is a medium sweet to medium taste. The whisky definitely
lengthens the finish with a familiar alcohol burn and heat.

I think I might have had it a little warm at first as chilling it
slightly mellows out the spirit heat to bring through more of the
honey flavours.

The combination of whisky and honey is definitely a warming one
(there's a reason hot toddies exist) and there are elements of
butterscotch that emerge by themselves, even without adding actual
butterscotch liqueur as they recommend.
