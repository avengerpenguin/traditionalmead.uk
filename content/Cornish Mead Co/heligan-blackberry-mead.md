From the [Cornish Mead Co's](/cornish-mead-co/) "Heligan" range, this is a
blackberry melomel based on a red grape base (so it qualifies as a
[pyment](/pyment/) as well).

From their own website:

> Inspired by the Lost Gardens of Heliganâ€™s rich flora and fauna, the Cornish Mead Co have produced this traditional red grape based rich Blackberry Mead

The Cornish Mead Co 

## Appearance

The colour is an opaque ruby red, perhaps indistinguishable from a red wine
with a similar deep, ruby appearance.

## Nose

The blackberry aroma is present, but not overpowering. Some honey notes are
detectable if you root around for a bit.

## Taste

The first sip is immediately a mix of medium sweet honey with a tartness coming
from the blackberries to balance it out. The tartness might be a bit strong
at first, but it mellows a little with air as it opens up in the glass.
