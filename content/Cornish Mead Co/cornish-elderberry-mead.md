A fruit-flavoured [pyment](/pyment/)
(does it count as a [melomel](/melomel/)?)
from [Cornish Mead Co](/cornish-mead-co/), this time with
elderberry.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

This range of drinks is sold in 25cl and 75cl bottles, so we bought a few
gift packs of the smaller ones to give each one a try! Their range of
pyment/melomel drinks seem to be all made from the same grape base.

## Appearance

The colour is a deep ruby that is barely see-through in a full glass.

## Nose

There is a pronounced aroma of bold elderberry coming right out of the
glass. There is some notes of other red/dark fruit presumably coming
from the grape base.

## Taste

This taste is definitely fruit forward with a more lingering finish
that other flavours such as their [cherry mead](/cornish-cherry-mead/).

The finish is a blend of sweetness and tartness. The fruit flavour in the
initial sip is bold, but the overall body in the mouth is more medium-bodied
compared to a powerful, full-bodied wine.

## Mead Cocktails

The Cornish Mead Co's website suggests using this drink as part of a
cocktail called
[Kernow Carnival](https://www.cornishmead.co.uk/cocktails/kernow-carnival/)
which includes rum, lime and mint. Sounds like a good Summer drink!
