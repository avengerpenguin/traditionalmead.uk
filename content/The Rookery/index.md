The Rookery calls itself a "craft mead" producer based in Perthshire, Scotland.
They claim they never use sugars os syrups and stick to honey as the main
fermentable in all their meads.

Their seasonal meads use hand-foraged ingredients, such as
spruce, mountain ash berries, crab-apples and a range of hedgerow berries,
which they claim to be hand-foraged in most cases.

They seem to produce more flavours than you can shake a stick at, but it is
also pretty tricky to obtain them all. Bottles of Rookery Craft Mead tend to
be available in [independent shops](http://www.rookery.scot/stockists/) but
you might catch them at big events such as the [Great British Beer Festival](https://www.gbbf.org.uk/whats-on/stalls/) or
even [Cambridge Beer Festival](https://www.cambridgebeerfestival.com/food-drink/mead/).
