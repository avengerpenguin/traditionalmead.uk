This is a "Welsh honey mead" from the
[New Quay Honey Farm](/new-quay-honey-farm/). They produce a variety of
flavours, but this appears to be their "pure" honey mead offering.

The farm is based in Ceredigion and has been a bee-keeping farm since 1995.
Today they produce honeys, meads, sweets and other products dervived from
honey.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

They claim to ferment at ambient temperatures using wildflower honey from their
own hives before maturing in casks for a mature flavour. Their process
supposedly takes two years, so we would hope for some good results at the end
of that period!

This classic mead comes in both a sweet and medium versions. It is the sweet
version tasted below.

## Appearance

This mead is a quite light in colour, but not as light as something
graped-based like [Lindisfarne mead](/lindisfarne/). The legs really cling to
the glass which made me think it was a lot stronger than the 13% ABV as it
says on the bottle.

## Nose

This is definitely not shy on the aroma! Quite a few simple means manage to
summon only a whiff of sweetness, but this packs a sweet and tangy punch that
opens up your nostrils.

## Taste

The initial taste brings a duality of sweetness and acidity. There are notes of
apricot perhaps and it finishes with a toastiness (toasted broiche?).
