A [metheglin (or spiced mead)](/metheglin-spiced-mead/)
from [New Quay Honey Farm](/new-quay-honey-farm/) flavoured with ginger with
a subtle, smooth taste.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The Afon Mêl are proudly made from pure honey as the fermentable and it shows
in a pure, smooth taste. This ginger-flavoured metheglin builds on top of that
high-quality base with a muted ginger flavouring that does not overwhelm.

Their meads are also matured in casks for a process that takes two years
overall, so this is likely contributing to the smoothness and maturity of the
final product.

## Appearance

The colour is slightly more golden than the pure mead, but still fairly
clear and see-through in the glass.

## Nose

The aroma is somewhere between subtle and pronounced, but with an almost
fruity body from the honey itself. There is a ginger scent at the back, but it's
subtle and the overall node is definitely honey-forward.

## Taste

As with the nose, a sweet and round flavour hits you first with the ginger
tingling at the back for a long finish. This mead has a substantial mouth-feel
and is overall well-balanced between the sweetness and the ginger spice.

## Food pairing

This mead could pair well with a curry or other spicy main dish. A bold choice
might be to try pairing with salmon or other seafoods.
