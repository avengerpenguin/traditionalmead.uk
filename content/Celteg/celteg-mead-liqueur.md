This is a [mead liqueur](/mead-liqueurs/) made by
Celtic Country Wines. The liqueur is made with whisky and weighs in at a
typical 20% ABV.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Overall, the liqueur doesn't differ too much from their
[Celteg pure "Medieval" mead](/celteg-medieval-mead/). If anything,
a 20% liqueur that drinks like a sweet mead might be considered a little
dangerous!

## Appearance

The colour is a light straw colour and the liqueur is very clear in appearance.

## Nose

The nose isn't overwhelmed with whisky or spirit as can be the case for some
liqueurs. The main aroma is the honey itself with perhaps a hint of
alcohol fortification.

## Taste

The taste is very similar to their
[Celteg pure "Medieval" mead](/celteg-medieval-mead/) with the whisky
provided a subtle, additional warmth. There is a slight burn from the
alcohol in the finish.
