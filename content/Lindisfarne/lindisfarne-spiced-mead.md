Another classic [pyment](/types-of-mead/) from [Lindisfarne](/lindisfarne/),
but this time flavoured with a blend of spices.

This is apparently the first new mead for half a century as traditionally they
produced only their classic variety since the 1960s.

From their own website:

    Proudly announcing our brand new Lindisfarne Spiced Mead!  Our first new mead in nearly half a century, it blends carefully chosen spices with our already famous mead to produce a delicious seasonal taste.  

A spiced mead is a good additional to any Christmas. It works well as both a
post-dinner dessert wine or warmed to be drunk like a mulled wine as the nights
get shorter. The comparison to [Lyme Bay's](/lyme-bay/) Christmas mead is hard
to avoid.

## Appearance

This is still rather light in colour, which is likely an effect of this being
being a [pyment](/types-of-mead/) made from fermenting grape juice. There are
more orange hues than the classic Lindisfarne mead though.

## Nose

The aroma reminds quite vividly of gingerbread and lebkuchen. This follows
naturally from a blend of spices inseperable from associations with Christmas.

## Taste

The grape base yields some dryness and acidity, albeit only subtly. This leads
to a refreshing "session" mead. The spices are notable, but perhaps more strongly
so in the aroma. In the taste, the spices sit nicely within the body of the
drink for a refreshing drink perfect for winter months. I've not tried it
warmed yet, but it seems that would work nicely for a Christmas drink.
