Mead is an ancient, alcoholic drink dating back as far as 7000 BCE in China. 
It is made by fermenting honey to produce a wine-strength drink typically 
between 8% and 25% ABV.

It can be quite sweet since not all the sugar in the honey is fermented 
usually, but the tastes can range from dry to sweet depending on the variety.
Many are fermented with fruits and spices for additional flavours.

The last decade or so has seen a resurgence of mead in the UK as well as 
other countries such as the United States.

## History of mead in the UK

Around 550 CE, the early Brythonic (Welsh) poet Taliesin wrote a poem about
mead called *Kanu y med* or "Song of Mead" (translated into English):

    WILL adore the Ruler, chief of every place, 
    Him, that supports the heaven: Lord of everything.
    Him, that made the water for every one good,
    Him, that made every gift, and prospers it.
    May Maelgwn of Mona be affected with mead, and affect us,
    From the foaming mead-horns, with the choicest pure liquor,
    Which the bees collect, and do not enjoy.
    Mead distilled sparkling, its praise is everywhere.
    The multitude of creatures which the earth nourishes,
    God made for man to enrich him.
    Some fierce, some mute, he enjoys them.
    Some wild, some tame, the Lord makes them.
    Their coverings become clothing.
    For food, for drink, till doom they will continue.
    I will implore the Ruler, sovereign of the country of peace,
    To liberate Elphin from banishment.
    The man who gave me wine and ale and mead.
    And the great princely steeds, beautiful their appearance,
    May he yet give me bounty to the end.
    By the will of God, he will give in honour,
    Five five-hundred festivals in the way of peace.
    Elphinian knight of mead, late be thy time of rest.

Another, medi√¶val Welsh poem, Y Gododdin, contains the stanza:

    Men went to Catraeth at morn
    Their high spirits lessened their life-span
    They drank mead, gold and sweet, ensnaring;
    For a year the minstrels were merry.
    Red their swords, let the blades remain
    Uncleansed, white shields and four-sided spearheads,
    Before Mynyddog Mwynfawr's men.

This poem tells how the ruler of the Gododdin, Mynyddog Mwynfawr, gathered
warriors from several Brythonic kingdoms and for a year's
feasting and drinking mead in his halls at Din Eidyn (now Edinburgh today)
shortly before attacking Catraeth (believed to be Catterick, North Yorkshire 
today).

There are also mentions of mead in Beowulf where Danish warriors drank mead and
Mead featured as a heroic drink in both German and Celtic poetry.

Tax and regulation drove commercial mead out of popularity with beer and 
wine being the predominant alcoholic drinks for some time. Many monasteries 
continued the tradition, however, since some areas of Britain are unsuitable
for grapes. Perhaps the most well-known of such monasteries is Lindisfarne, 
after which Lindisfarne mead is still named today.

## How mead is made

Mead is made by mixing honey with water and then fermenting with yeast (with
wine yeasts being popular among mead producers). See
[Making Mead](/making-mead) for a more thorough step-by-step guide.

## Varieties

Within the UK alone, meads can vary from a dark, caramel style to a lighter 
style. There are also a lot of varieties with specific names:

* *Acerglyn:* Meads with maple syrup.

* *Bochet:* Mead where the honey is caramelised or burnt first.

* *Braggot:* Originally *bragawd* in Welsh, a mead traditionally made with 
hops but these days that has generally become malted grain.

* *Capsicumel:* Mead with chillies.

* *Cyser:* Mead made with apples or apple juice, making a drink similar to 
cider.

* *Great mead:* Mead aged for a long time.

* *Melomel:* A mead flavoured with any fruits.

* *Metheglin:* A mead made with spices such as ginger, tea, orange peel,
  nutmeg, coriander, cinnamon, cloves or vanilla.

* *Pyment*: A mead with grape added or a grape (white) wine that has had 
honey added. This is the style used by Lindisfarne mead and a lot of pyments
are actually sold as just meads without distinction.

* *Rhodomel:* A mead made from honey, rose hips, rose petals or rose attar.

* *Sack mead:* A mead made with more honey than usual. This ends up being 
denser, strong in alcohol (closer to a fortified wine).

* *Short mead or quick mead:* A mead made quickly. It is designed to age 
much more quickly and be closer to a cider or ale in strength and character.

* *Show mead:* This is a term that as emerged for "plain" mead, i.e. simply 
fermented honey and water with nothing else added.
