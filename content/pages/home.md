Traditional Mead UK is your first stop for buying mead, trying mead or 
making mead at home.

We have pain-stakingly drunk our way through every mead, pyment, cyser,
melomel and metheglin we can find to
buy in the UK (and beyond!).

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

In fact, our work is still incomplete, so please do
comment with your own opinions even if we have yet to post our own
tasting notes.

## What is mead?

Mead is an ancient, alcoholic drink dating back as far as 7000 BCE in China. 
It is made by fermenting honey to produce a wine-strength drink typically 
between 8% and 25% ABV.
