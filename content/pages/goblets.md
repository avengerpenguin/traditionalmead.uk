Title: Drinking vessels to match your mead drinking persona
Date: 2017-04-18

With mead being a very ancient drink, we can't help but associate it with
ancient peoples: Vikings, Celts and Mediæval Europe. The association has also
made its way into multiple fantasy works inspired by the dark and middles ages
such as *The Lord of the Rings* or *A Game of Thrones*.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Of course, some of you might be happy just to treat mead as any other
wine-like drink and drink it from a wine glass without an elevated sense of
grandeur or escapism.

But many of you might want more melodrama and a sense of awesomeness when
drinking. For those in the latter group,
we've compiled a list of awesome-looking drinking vessels you
can find on Etsy UK.

We've also kindly categorised it based on whether you feel more like a Viking,
Celt or Hobbit when you drink your mead. You're welcome.

*(Many links below are affiliate links that support this website, but we have
no link with any particular Etsy seller other than we think their drinking
vessels look awesome.)*

## Viking

You can't consider yourself a viking if you drink from non-horn-shaped vessels,
so for the Viking-inclined among you, we recommend
[an extra large Viking drinking horn](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/504548812/extra-large-natural-viking-drinking-horn).

An advantage with any vessel without a flat bottom is that it prevents you
from putting your drink down, so you get through a lot more mead. If that's
something you consider a downside, perhaps you'd be more comfortable with
[horn-shaped tankards](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/513828997/viking-drinking-horn-mug-natural).

## Celtic

The Celts were a widespread and diverse people, so it's difficult to pin down
any particular drinking vessel stereotype. This also means we can apply quite
a lot of artist licence.

The most accurate might be to stick to a ceramic drinking cup, with
[this "Celtic Blue Spiral Cup"] being a close approximation. You could also go
downa richer route with a
[modern pewter goblet with celtic knot design](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/198486636/celtic-kells-knot-pewter-goblet).

We're not sure how traditional this is, but we also like
[this leather tankard](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/238649445/personalised-celtic-style-embossed).

## Celtic: Scottish

Whilst a lot more modern with roots in the 17th Century, someone who wants
a Scottish slant to their drinking could consider
[a quaich](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/486395699/lughs-knot-quaich-hand-made-and-design).

The word quaich comes from the Scottish Gaelic *cuach* (meaning cup) and was
originally intended for whisky. No reason not to branch out to mead or use
it for a mead liqueur perhaps.

## Goth

Intimidate your enemies with the foreboding combination of a black tree and 
a crow's skull at its base with this[tree and crow skull goblet](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/486551943/tree-and-crow-skull-goblet).


## Fantasy: Lord of the Rings

Mead gets a mention in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings as part of Galadriel's
song of Eldamar:

> The long years have passed like swift draughts 
> of the sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West

This absolutely gives the excuse for obsessive *Lord of the Rings* fans to
consider a mediæval-style
[tankard stamped with Elvish writing](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/182873313/tolkien-inspired-mugs-the-one-mug-by)
or perhaps just
[a tankard stamped with the Tree of Gondor](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/260597290/tolkien-inspired-mugs-tree-of-gondor-by).

A bonus mention of mead also appears in *The Hobbit*:

> They sat long at the table with their wooden drinking bowls filled with mead.

So, if you want to feel more Hobbit with your mead drinking, you can get
yourself replicas of the
[old Germanic wooden drinking bowls](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/462859978/maple-wood-mazur-drinking-bowls).

## Fantasy: Game of Thrones

There is also a mention of mead in the novel *A Dance with Dragons* as part of
the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series (aka "Game of Thrones"):

> That day Tormund bellowed often and loudly. He roared, he shouted, he slammed
his fist against the table so hard that a flagon of water overturned and
spilled. A horn of mead was never far from his hand, so the spittle he sprayed
when making threats was sweet with honey. He called Jon Snow a craven, a liar,
and a turncloak, cursed him for a black-hearted buggering kneeler, a robber,
and a carrion crow, accused him of wanting to f**k the free folk up the arse.
Twice he flung his drinking horn at Jon's head, though only after he had
emptied it. Tormund was not the sort of man to waste good mead. Jon let it all
wash over him. He never raised his own voice nor answered threat with threat,
but neither did he give more ground than he had come prepared to give.

Inspired by this (and by the huge surge in mead sales caused by the
*Game of Thrones* TV series), we tried to find a drinking horn best suited for
a Game of Thrones fan. The best we could find on Etsy was
[this "horn" beer mug](https://www.etsy.com/listing/200826042/on-sale-game-of-thrones-horn-beer-mug)
that mentions *Game of Thrones* in the title and we think the "mug" style would
be somewhat easier to throw at Jon Snow's head than a full horn.

## I want to be a king/queen

We couldn't resist rounding this off with some of the more outrageously-extravagant
goblets and chalices that you can buy from Etsy. A lot of these are one-off
items, so we can't guarantee they won't be gone when you click the links!

### [Wine Goblet, Amethyst Gemstones, 925 Sterling silver, Yemenite Filigree](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/488709159/exclusive-wine-goblet-amethyst-gemstones)

You can't go wrong with amethyst if you're trying to look extravagant. You may
think this is a lot to spend on a cup, but it does come with free shipping...

### [Want to drink from a silver thistle?](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/505221449/1891-antique-victorian-thistle-goblet)

An antique from 1891 means you might not be drinking from this every day. But
surely once you own it, non-thistle-shaped cups would feel too pedestrian for
the rest of your life?

### [Set of 8 silver goblets for royal guests](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/525080565/set-of-8-vintage-wallace-sterling-silver)

What would any king or queen be without hosting receptions for other royal
families? If you want to avoid being selfish with your mead drinking, we
recommend you consider buying your silver goblets in sets of 8 or more.

### [Pewter goblet with "mythical" dragon sculpture](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/492200022/amazing-ballena-bay-8-12-tall-pewter)

This one has a dragon sculpture for a base. If that doesn't sell it to you,
then I don't know what will.
