## Where to buy homebrew mead kits

* [Traditional Mead Honey Wine Making Kit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Traditional-Making-Starter-Bottles-Homebrew/dp/B00QTE7R34/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1488412516&sr=8-14&keywords=mead&linkCode=ll1&tag=traditionalmead-21&linkId=54f410a4c1734911f4b7ff28c81a2aa9)

## Ingredients

* Honey (1.4kg or 3lb) -- Use real, natural honey for the best results.
* Distilled water (1 gallon or 3.8l)
* Yeast
* Any other flavourings such as fruit or spices

## Preparation

Fully sterlise any equipment as the fermentation process is favourable to 
growth of bacteria and other microorganisms too. Many of the kits listed 
above come with a sterilising solution or powder.

## Make up "must" mixture for your mead

First you need to liquify your honey (preferably using a warm water bath) and
then mix it with the distilled water. There is no need to heat or boil this
mixture. You now have what is known as "must" (the same term used in wine
making). At this point you can optionally mix in fruits or spices to add some
unique flavour to your mead.

Now you can add the yeast to your must. Some yeasts require some rehydration
first, so check the label for any instructions.

## Store and ferment your mead

Place in a fermantation bucket or any other large, sterilised container. You
 want to ensure the following:
 
 * The container should not beoverly full -- leave room for a lively 
 fermentation!
 * You need to stop air getting in, while still allowing carbon dioxide to
   escape. Many of the kits listed above come with a proper airlock, but a 
   you can get away with poking holes in a balloon and 
   stretching over the top of the container (secure with tape or an elastic 
   band).
 * Leave the mead fermenting in a location that keeps it at the right 
 temperature. Check the label for your yeast to see if any particular 
 temperature is recommended.


## Check the gravity

*Specific gravity* (SG) is the density of your must at any time. You can get 
the *original gravity* (OG) by measuring with a hydrometer. Pure water has an 
SG of exactly 1, so your mixture is going to be something like 1.100 (each 
1lb of honey seems to add 0.035 of gravity).

SG is expected to go down (attentuate) during the fermentation process as 
the yeast converts the sugars into alcohol.

You can predict what the *final gravity* (FG) will be by predicting how much
sugar your yeast will convert into alcohol. First we can use a simple 
formula that estimates the ABV of your fermented drink:

    (OG - FG) x 131 = ABV
    
That is, if your original gravity is 1.100 and then you measure the final 
gravity after fermentation stops to get 1.005, then you can plug OG and FG 
into the formula above to get:

    (1.100 - 1.005) x 131 = (0.095) x 131 = 12.4%
    
Your yeast should have a known alcohol tolerance. For example, Lalvin 
EC-1118 is a popular Champagne yeast that is good for making a strong mead 
and its rated tolerance is 18%.

If we use that tolerance as an estimate for what our final ABV will be, we
can use the formula above in reverse:

    OG - (ABV / 131) = FG 

And then plug in 18% as our estimated final ABV along with an example original
gravity of 1.150 (this example is higher as more honey is needed for such a 
strong mead):

    FG = 1.150 - (18 / 131) = 1.150 - 0.138 = 1.012 

Note that if the original gravity had been 0.100 as per our first example, the
formula would suggest a FG below 1, which is impossible! In that case, it's 
telling us that the yeast would ferment all the sugar out of the must and 
the final mead will be quite dry.

If you want to retain some sweetness to your final mead, choose an ABV for 
the formula 1% or so above what the yeast can manage. So we might make a 
must with an original gravity that would create an ABV of 19% or 20% for a 
yeast with a tolerance of 18%. This ensures that fermentation stops *before*
all the sugar turns into alcohol.

## Aerate for the first sugar break

Once we know the estimated, final gravity (FG), we can get the attenuation 
from the simple different of OG and FG, e.g.
 
    Attenuation = OG - FG = 1.100 - 1.005 = 0.095
    
If we divide that number into thirds (e.g. 0.032), then our first sugar break
is at:

    1.100 - 0.032 = 1.068
    
In our example here, the yeast needs aerating (i.e. allow oxygen in) while the
specific gravity is between 1.100 and 1.068. Ensure that you aerate daily for
that first third of gravity attenuation, maybe more than once a day if you can.

## Wait

You will need to ferment for probably at leaast 8 weeks. You can bottle 
after that time if you wish, but there's a few more nuanced things to look 
out for if you want to be more precise.

A simple sign that fermentation has stopped is when the bubbling has stopped.
If you are using an air lock and see no bubble for 3 weeks, then you're good
to go.

Another sign is that there is no change in your specific gravity for several
days.

There are a few different ways to know when the mead is done fermenting:[2]

The most accurate way to know is to measure the specific gravity with a
hydrometer when you first mix it, then measure it every two weeks. The chosen
yeast has a published ABV tolerance, and the hydrometer reading can be used to
determine what the final gravity of the mead should be. When the mead reaches
this gravity, wait a minimum of 4-6 months before bottling to ensure all CO2
that was in suspension in the mead has degassed. If the mead has not properly
degassed and too much CO2 for the rating of the type of bottle the mead is
bottled in is transferred, there is a risk of bottle explosion with temperature
swings.

Wait at least 8 weeks. The amount of time it takes for the mead to ferment will
depend on a variety of factors, but 8 weeks should be enough time for most
scenarios.

If you're using an airlock, wait until 3 weeks after it stops bubbling.

## Age your mead

Transfer your fermented must to a large container such as a demijohn to 
store for aging. Make sure there is no space for air if possible. We want to
minimise the amount of mead touching the air.

The longer you spend aging the mead, the better. You will probably want to 
leave this for a good 6 to 8 months, but some advice on other sites 
advocates bottling after 2-3 months!

## Bottle it!

Transfer the mead into bottles, seal, and store in a cool dark place. Open 
and enjoy when you feel the need for mead.
