Within the UK alone, meads can vary from a dark, caramel style to a lighter 
style. There are also a lot of varieties with specific names:

* *Acerglyn:* Meads with maple syrup.

* *Bochet:* Mead where the honey is caramelised or burnt first.

* *Braggot:* Originally *bragawd* in Welsh, a mead traditionally made with 
hops but these days that has generally become malted grain.

* *Capsicumel:* Mead with chillies.

* *Cyser:* Mead made with apples or apple juice, making a drink similar to 
cider. Examples of this in the UK include [Long Mynd Heather Honey Mead](/long-mynd-heather-honey-mead/)
and [Mabinogion Mead Four Branches](/mabinogion-mead-four-branches/).

* *Great mead:* Mead aged for a long time.

* *Melomel:* A mead flavoured with any fruits.

* *Metheglin:* A mead made with spices such as ginger, tea, orange peel,
  nutmeg, coriander, cinnamon, cloves or vanilla.

* *Pyment*: A mead with grape added or a grape (white) wine that has had 
honey added. This is the style used by Lindisfarne mead and a lot of pyments
are actually sold as just meads without distinction. 
[Long Mynd Heather Honey Mead](/long-mynd-heather-honey-mead/) is arguably
part pyment, part cyser.

* *Rhodomel:* A mead made from honey, rose hips, rose petals or rose attar.

* *Sack mead:* A mead made with more honey than usual. This ends up being 
denser, strong in alcohol (closer to a fortified wine).

* *Short mead or quick mead:* A mead made quickly. It is designed to age 
much more quickly and be closer to a cider or ale in strength and character.

* *Show mead:* This is a term that as emerged for "plain" mead, i.e. simply 
fermented honey and water with nothing else added. We have many following a
classic mead style in the UK including
[Lyme Bay Traditional mead](/lyme-bay-traditional/) and
[Moniack mead](/moniack-mead/).
