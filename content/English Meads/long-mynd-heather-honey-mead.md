The London Honey Co. claims to be the first mead producer in London. This 
mead is perhaps more a cyser with the Kentish apples added to the Shropshire
heather honey. The drink is finished with calvados and grape juice making 
this an interesting drink with aspects of mead, cider and wine.

## Colour

This drink is a pale golden colour with remarkable clarity.

## Nose

There is a fragrant -- arguably floral -- honey aroma with a sense of depth,
perhaps due to the mix of fruits.

## Taste

The taste is surprisingly dry given the flora and honey aromas. The grape 
juice is bring with it the usual sourness and tannins you would get from a 
white wine grape such as Chenin Blanc.

It is definitely a cysder or pyment rather than a mead. There are some honey
undertones that add a notable amount of complexity to the overall drink, but
the body is a little lacking.
