Another offering from Lyme Bay, this mead is another of the darker styles 
spiced with ginger. This leads to a warming, comforting mead drink for the 
colder months of the year.

## Colour

The colour is a reddish-brown reminiscent of autumn.

## Nose

The aroma is overwhelmed with ginger. There are hints of honey at the start 
just before the ginger kicks in.

## Taste

The taste is not far off the [traditional mead](/lyme-bay-traditional) in 
terms of body and sweetness, but the ginger quickly takes over and is a 
dominating flavour.
