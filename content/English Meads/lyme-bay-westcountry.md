<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Colour

A light orange-brown colour that appears like most of the darker meads
such as [Lyme Bay's traditional mead](/lyme-bay-traditional), but
somewhat on the lighter side of that category.

## Nose

The nose offers a warm, sweet bouquet. There is a subtle amount of
spice in the aroma.

## Taste

There is a definite spice on the initial taste that is drawn out to
the finish. The main body of the taste brings in small amounts of the
sweet, caramel flavour typical of
[Lyme Bay's traditional mead](/lyme-bay-traditional). Overall the
balance between sweetness and spice is well constructed, complex and
pairs wonderfully with Welsh cakes!
