This is a medium sweet [pure honey mead](/pure-honey-mead/) from
Avalon Vineyard. It is the only mead they produce (if you don't count
the mead liqueur. It is only 12% ABV and approved
by the Soil Association for its adherence to organic standards.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Appearance

This has quiet a vibrant yellow colour I have seen in a lot of meads,
particularly pure honey ones. There is a reasonable amount of viscosity
considering the alcoholic strength is only 12% ABV.

## Nose

There is a strong nose on this one. There is a distinctiveness in the honey
aromas and a sharpness balancing out the sweetness.

## Taste

The taste is definitely not a sweet one and more in the medium category. There
is a nice honey flavour in the initial sip, but the taste isn't very long or
complex afterwards.

The body feels like thin, which makes it quaffable if medium sweet is your
thing, but it does not put in the category of warming, winter meads. It is
probably the exact sweet-dry balance I would expect from a producer that makes
a lot of scrumpy, so maybe this would make an excellent base for a cyser or
melomel.
