## Appearance

Fizzes in a lively way not too far from prosecco. The colour is only slightly
more yellow that a prosecco or Champagne. You may be able to pour this in
Champagne flutes as an aperitif and fool a few people briefly!

## Nose

## Taste

A crisp, refreshing taste. The grapefruit balances with the honey for a drink
that would compete with many semi-sweet sparkling wines.
