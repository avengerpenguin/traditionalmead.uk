A mint-flavoured mead from the English Heritage-branded range produced
by [Lyme Bay Winery](/lyme-bay-winery/).

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

They do not appear to be selling this via the online
[English Heritage shop](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5926&awinaffid=333769&clickref=garden-mint&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.english-heritageshop.org.uk%2F)
any more.

## Appearance

The colour is reasonably pale and the drink is very clear in the glass.

## Nose

Mint is a fairly powerful aroma, so it's no surprise that it dominates the
nose somewhat. It is not overwhelming, however, and some of the honey notes
still come through.

## Taste

They have attempted to keep the taste a balance between the mint and honey
flavours and they have been somewhat successful here. The mint lingers by
itself on the finish and the drink definitely tastes of mint, which may
be an acquired taste for some.
