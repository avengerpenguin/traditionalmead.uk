    <h1>What is&nbsp;mead?</h1>
    

    <p>Mead is an ancient, alcoholic drink dating back as far as 7000 <span class="caps">BCE</span> in China. 
It is made by fermenting honey to produce a wine-strength drink typically 
between 8% and 25% <span class="caps">ABV</span>.</p>
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

<p>It can be quite sweet since not all the sugar in the honey is fermented 
usually, but the tastes can range from dry to sweet depending on the variety.
Many are fermented with fruits and spices for additional&nbsp;flavours.</p>
<p>The last decade or so has seen a resurgence in popularity in the <span class="caps">UK</span> as well as 
other countries such as the United&nbsp;States.</p>
