The [New Quay Honey Farm](/new-quay-honey-farm/) is quite prolific in
producing multiple flavours of their "Welsh honey mead" on top of
their ["pure" honey mead](/new-quay-honey-farm-afon-mel-honey-mead/).
Today's mead is their apricot flavour.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Apricot is a flavour that naturally emerges in some of the more complex wine
grapes such as Chardonnay and Viognier, so it's not too much of a stretch to
see an apricot mead pair with savoury foods.

Moroccan cuisine commonly uses apricots and sweeter wines generally pair well
with spicy, Middle Eastern foods. It's possible to match apricot melomel well
with Indian food as well, but other fruits such as mango might be a stronger
match (in place of mango lassi which is common in Indian restaurants in the UK).

A mead flavoured with fruit is technically known as a
[melomel](/types-of-mead/).

## Appearance

This mead (melomel) is a little deeper in colour than the
["pure" honey mead](/new-quay-honey-farm-afon-mel-honey-mead/). It has more
orange hues presumably taken from the apricot fruit itself.

## Nose

There is a bold bouquet as with the pure mead. The apricot flavours are
pronounced.

## Taste

The first taste is a strong, sweet one that carries the apricot well. The
acidity seems lower than the pure mead, but that be an effect of the apricot
flavour given the fruit is almost certainly more acidic than the honey, if
anything.
