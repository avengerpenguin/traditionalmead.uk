This is a [pure honey mead](/pure-honey-mead/) from
[New Quay Honey Farm](/new-quay-honey-farm/) made with heather honey which gives it a richer taste and fuller body.

The richness of mead from heather honey can make a mead start to feel closer to a liqueur in terms of mouth-feel than a wine, although still with wine strength.

Their meads are also matured in casks for a process that takes two years overall, so this is likely contributing to the smoothness and maturity of the final product.

## Appearance

The colour sits between straw and gold with a great see-through clarity in the glass.

## Nose

The nose is reasonably pronounced with a somewhat floral scent from the honey itself. The floral notes definitely dominate over the sweeter, honey tones.

## Taste

A floral, heather taste hits on the first sip but then a smooth, sweet flavour fills the mouth straight after. There is a reasonable body to this mead with a moreish sweetness that does not come across as overly sickly.

## Food pairing

With the rich, sweet nature of this mead, a dessert pairing is always good.
However it is also
tempting to try pairing these more luxurious meads with cheeses.
