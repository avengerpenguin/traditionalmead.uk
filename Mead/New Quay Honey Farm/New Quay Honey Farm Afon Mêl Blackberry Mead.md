Another [melomel](/melomel-fruit-flavoured-mead/)
from [New Quay Honey Farm](/new-quay-honey-farm/) and this time with
blackberry.

Blackberry is a fruit that pairs a bit more with savoury foods than,
say, raspberry. Meat dishes such as duck would be ideal, but it's best to avoid anything too acidic, salty or bitter. Many simple meat dishes like chicken might well pair just as nicely.

Cheese is acidic and salty, but on many occasions I have paired baked
Camembert with blackberries, so I might be tempted to ignore the
advice and pull this mead out next time I serve it.

## Appearance

There is a deep, tawny colour in the body. It is a little lighter than the [raspberry version](/new-quay-honey-farm-afon-mel-raspberry-mead/), but quite similar otherwise.

## Nose

The aroma is more subtle than the raspberry and apricot
meads. Unsurprisingly, the nose is mainly blackberry notes with even
the alcohol seeming quite muted.

## Taste

The initial taste is a gentle balance of tartness and sweetness. The
honey and alcohol provide a pleasing tingle that leads into a slight
dryness for the finish. This mead drinks nicely on its own without
begging to be used as a dessert wine -- something you might find with
the bolder fruit flavours.
