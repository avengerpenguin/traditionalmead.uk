## Appearance

A slightly orangey-yellow colour with gentle fizz on pouring.

## Nose

The hops dominate the nose and would pass for a hopped beer if not for some of the sweet aromas from the honey coming through.

## Taste

A gentle sweet taste at first over which a bitter hop taste rises very
quickly. More sweetness comes back for the aftertaste to pair with the bitter hops for a compex and long finish.
