[[The London Honey Co.]] claims to be the first mead producer in
London. This mead is perhaps more a [[Cyser]] with the Kentish apples
added to the Shropshire heather honey. The drink is finished with
calvados and grape juice making this an interesting drink with aspects of mead, cider and wine.

## Colour

This drink is a pale golden colour with remarkable clarity. This is
perhaps closer to a sweet, white wine like Gew√ºrztraminer in
appearance. This may be unsurprising given the use of apples and grapes in the recipe.

## Nose

There is a fragrant -- arguably floral -- honey aroma with a sense of
depth. There are some fruit characteristics, but it is hard to pick out certain fruits in particular.

## Taste

The taste is surprisingly dry given the flora and honey aromas. The
grape juice is bringing with it the usual sourness and acidity you
would get from a white wine grape such as Sauvignon Blanc or Chenin Blanc.

It is definitely a [[Cyser]] or [[Pyment]] rather than a mead. There are some
honey undertones that add a notable amount of complexity to the
overall drink, but the body is a little lacking and the finish is somewhat
short.
