This is the pure honey, "traditional" mead offering
from [Friary Liqueurs](/friary-liqueurs/). It is 14% ABV and
advertises on the label that it is best served chilled or slightly
warm, so I guess room temperature is unacceptable.

## Appearance

This is very light in colour compared to most meads. In fact, the
colour is getting towards the that of [[Lindisfarne]], but not quite as pale since [[Lindisfarne]] is a grape-based [[Pyment]] whereas this Friary mead is actually a mead (fermented from honey).

The viscosity is lower than a lot of other meads too, which either
suggest lower alcohol or a lot of the sugar has been fermented
away. Given the 14% alcohol, my money is on the latter.

## Nose

The honey aroma is gentle on this one. Not quite strong enough to stop the alcohol coming through with it, which is a good or bad thing
depending on your outlook on life or how far through the week we are.

## Taste

The taste is actually more complex and longer than I assumed from the
gentleness of the aroma. There is a gentle sweetness, yes, but not
overly (or sickly!) so. There is a rising heat and sharpness as the
alcohol hits, which mellows out to slight dryness.

Overall, I think I would describe this as a medium sweet mead rather
than just "sweet", but the bottle does not advertise it as such. It's
not a truly [[Dry Meads]] such as [[Dragonsbreath Baldur]] by any means, but the sweetness isn't as heavy as, say, [[Lyme Bay Traditional Mead]] mead.
