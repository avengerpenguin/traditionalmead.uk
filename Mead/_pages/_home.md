Traditional Mead UK is your first stop for buying mead, trying mead or [[Making Mead]] at home.

We have pain-stakingly drunk our way through every mead, [[Pyment]], [[Cyser]], melomel and metheglin we can find to buy in the UK (and beyond!).

In fact, our work is still incomplete, so please do comment with your own opinions even if we have yet to post our own tasting notes.

## What is mead?

Mead is an ancient, alcoholic drink dating back as far as 7000 BCE in China. It is made by fermenting honey to produce a wine-strength drink typically between 8% and 25% ABV.
