Within the UK alone, meads can vary from a dark, caramel style to a lighter style. There are also a lot of varieties with specific names:

- _Acerglyn:_ Meads with maple syrup.

- _Bochet:_ Mead where the honey is caramelised or burnt first.

- _Braggot:_ Originally _bragawd_ in Welsh, a mead traditionally made with hops but these days that has generally become malted grain.

- [[Capsicumel (Chilli Mead)|Capsicumel]]: Mead with chillies.

- [[Cyser]]: Mead made with apples or apple juice, making a drink similar to cider.

- _Great mead:_ Mead aged for a long time.

- [[Melomel (Fruit-flavoured Mead)|Melomel]]: A mead flavoured with any fruits.

- [[Metheglin (Spiced Mead)|Metheglin]]: A mead made with spices such as ginger, tea, orange peel, nutmeg, coriander, cinnamon, cloves or vanilla.

- _Pyment_: A mead with grape added or a grape (white) wine that has had honey added. This is the style used by Lindisfarne mead and a lot of pyments are actually sold as just meads without distinction.

- _Rhodomel:_ A mead made from honey, rose hips, rose petals or rose attar.

- _Sack mead:_ A mead made with more honey than usual. This ends up being denser, strong in alcohol (closer to a fortified wine).

- _Short mead or quick mead:_ A mead made quickly. It is designed to age much more quickly and be closer to a cider or ale in strength and character.

- _Show mead:_ This is a term that as emerged for "plain" mead, i.e. simply fermented honey and water with nothing else added. We have many following a classic mead style in the UK including [[Lyme Bay Traditional Mead]] and [[Moniack Mead]].
