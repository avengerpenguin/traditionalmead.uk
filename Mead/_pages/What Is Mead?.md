It can be quite sweet since not all the sugar in the honey is fermented
usually, but the tastes can range from dry to sweet depending on the variety.
Many are fermented with fruits and spices for additional flavours.

The last decade or so has seen a resurgence in popularity in the UK as well as
other countries such as the United States.
