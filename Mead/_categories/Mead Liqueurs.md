There is certainly a lot of variety under the "mead" banner these days. While
strictly, there are
[different names for different variants of mead](/types-of-mead/), the term
mead seems to have been accepted for a broad range of drinks derived from
honey.

Traditional mead was typically brewed to wine strength, which follows naturally
from the high sugar content in honey and the usage of yeasts popular in wine
making. However, the rise in popularity of mead has brought much creativity
to the industry and given us a lot more choice.

In one direction, there is the rise in [beer-strength "craft mead"](/craft-mead/)
that can typically be in the region of 5% ABV. This makes it more of a session
"pub" drink. Then in the other direction, there are of course stronger
liqueurs derived from mead or honey too.

In our list below, we have tried any we find that specifically put "mead" in
the name. This might include simple liqueurs that are flavoured with honey
but also liqueur-strength drinks that are truly derived from a mead recipe.

It is common to make a traditional mead and then fortify with spirits such
as whisky. This is certainly the case with
[Friary's mead liqueur](/friary-mead-liqueur/). Honey and whisky have a long
history together not only because of the medicinal properties they bring
to a hot toddy!
