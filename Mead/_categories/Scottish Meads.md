The most famous mead associated with Scotland is probably
[Moniack mead](/moniack-mead/). It is named after Moniack castle near
Inverness, but production has moved down to Devon after
[Highland Wineries](/highland-wineries/) was fully bought by
[Lyme Bay Winery](/lyme-bay-winery/). We have kept the "Scottish" tag on this
mead to honour its history, but we must also acknowledge truly Scottish mead
producers too.

The most impressive we have come across so far is [[The Rookery]],
who produce [[Craft Mead]] in Perthshire.

We have struggled so far to find more producers in Scotland. England seems
to be dominating the more modern "craft" scene with trendy producers such
as [Zymurgorium](/zymurgorium/) while both Wales and South-West England do
well for the more traditional approaches with
[New Quay Honey Farm's Afon MÃªl](/new-quay-honey-farm/) and
[Lyme Bay](/lyme-bay-winery/).

Do you know of any more producers in Scotland we are yet to find? Please let us know in the comments!
