A mead from [Lyme Bay Winery](/lyme-bay-winery/)
that has recently won a Taste of the West gold
award in 2016. The added spices strictly make this drink is a
[metheglin](/types-of-mead) rather than a pure mead.

This is one of three spiced offerings from Lyme Bay. See also their
[Tournament mead](/lyme-bay-tournament/) spiced with ginger or their excellent
[Christmas mead](/lyme-bay-christmas/).

## Colour

A light orange-brown colour that appears like most of the darker meads
such as [Lyme Bay's traditional mead](/lyme-bay-traditional-mead/), but
somewhat on the lighter side of that category.

## Nose

The nose offers a warm, sweet bouquet. There is a subtle amount of
spice in the aroma. There are notes of heather among the honey flavours.

## Taste

There is a definite spice on the initial taste that is drawn out to
the finish. The main body of the taste brings in small amounts of the
sweet, caramel flavour typical of
[Lyme Bay's traditional mead](/lyme-bay-traditional-mead/). Overall the
balance between sweetness and spice is well constructed, complex and
pairs wonderfully with Welsh cakes!
