Another offering from [Lyme Bay Winery](/lyme-bay-winery/),
this mead is another of the darker
styles spiced with ginger. This leads to a warming, comforting mead
drink for the colder months of the year. The ginger spices means this is a
[metheglin](/types-of-mead) rather than a "normal" mead.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Colour

The colour is a reddish-brown reminiscent of autumn.

## Nose

The aroma is overwhelmed with ginger. There are hints of honey at the
start just before the ginger kicks in.

## Taste

The taste is not far off the [traditional mead](/lyme-bay-traditional)
in terms of body and sweetness, but the ginger quickly takes over and
is a dominating flavour.
