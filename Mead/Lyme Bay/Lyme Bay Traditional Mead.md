[Lyme Bay Winery](/lyme-bay-winery/)
in Axminster produces a lot of traditional English drinks 
including mead, fruit wines and liqueurs. Their traditional mead is perhaps 
their flagship mead, which sells pretty well due to being stocked at English
Heritage gifts shops up and down England.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Lyme Bay Winery's traditional mead was awarded a one star "Great Taste"
gold award in 2013 and it is certainly well-deserved.

## Colour

This is a relatively dark style, with usual notes of burnt caramel and a 
reasonable body to balance out the honey sweetness. This is perhaps similar 
in style to [Moniack Mead](/moniack-mead) and there's quite the debate as 
to which comes first between the two!

## Nose

The first aroma is definitely a sweet one, perhaps more strongly so than the
Moniack mead. There is also more of a fruity aroma whereas some similar 
meads -- like the Moniack again -- might be a little more floral.

## Taste

The first taste is just on the dry side of sweet -- compared to some sweeter
meads in the darker style. There are stronger burnt notes also on the 
finish, which ultimately leads to a pleasing balance of toasty flavours and 
sweetness.
