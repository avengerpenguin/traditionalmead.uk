This mead (_hydromel_ in French) is known in Brittany as a [[Chouchen]], which is a mead specific to the region, traditionally made with buckwheat honey for a stronger flavour.

Produced by [[Liqueurs Fisselier]], this is the "classic" pure honey where their other offerings normally have a fruit flavouring.

The bottle says to drink it chilled, but I read that after pouring a glass so I have tasted it both at room temperature and chilled. It is apparently drunk as an apéritif (French for _apéritif_).

## Appearance

This one is very much a honey colour: a deep orange-yellow colour.

## Nose

Much like the colour, the aroma is simply that of honey. Many meads do not achieve a true honey aroma, so it is impressive to experience a robust retention of the pure sight and smell of honey itself in the fermentation process.

## Taste

The initial taste is a surprise: not nearly as strong as the aroma would suggest, but then the flavours build up for a strong aftertaste. The sweetness has hints of caramel such that it reminds of [[Moniack Mead]] or maybe even [[Lyme Bay Traditional Mead]], but there is additional complexity.

The additional flavours are similar to the deep sweetness of apple juice, which fits the original tradition of making [[Chouchen]] with apples or cider. I believe this mead is made purely with honey however.
