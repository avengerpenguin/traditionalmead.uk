A bold melomel flavour from Brittany-based [[Chouchen]] producer [[Liqueurs Fisselier]]: "hydromel au pamplemousse" or _grapefruit mead_.

## Appearance

The colour barely deviates from [[Fisselier Hydromelix Classic Mead]]. There might be a very slight pink hue, but I also might be imagining it.

## Nose

The first whiff gives up a nice grapefruit aroma, but slight chemical notes come shortly after. As with a lot of citrus fruits these days, it's hard not to be reminded of washing-up liquid when you smell the flavour.

## Taste

The initial sip brings all the sweet flavours first. There is a subtle base sweetness from the honey combined with the fruity aspects of the grapefruit flavour. The aftertaste is pretty much exactly the same as grapefruit juice itself.
