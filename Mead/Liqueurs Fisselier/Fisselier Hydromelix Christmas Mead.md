A Christmas-themed offering from the Hydromelix produced by
[Liqueurs Fisselier](/liqueurs-fisselier/). The French name is
_Hydromelix de Noël: Hydromel aux Épices_.


## Appearance

The drink is fairly clear in appearance. The colour is golden with a slight amber hue as is typical of many [[Metheglin (Spiced Mead)|metheglins]].


## Nose

The aroma is mainly sweet and fruity with a background of clove and other spices.


## Taste

The spices are reasonably integrated and not overbearing. The taste is fairly dominated with the [[Chouchen]] itself with the spices coming into their own in the finish. The spice that stands out the most appears to be cloves, giving this mead justification for its Christmas label.
