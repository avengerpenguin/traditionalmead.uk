This is a lightly spiced mead from the [[Cwm Deri]] vineyard in
Pembrokeshire, Wales. As a spiced mead, this is technically a [[Metheglin (Spiced Mead)|metheglin]] and the giveaway is in the name since "metheglin" is simply the English word for the Welsh "meddeglyn".

## Appearance

This mead has an appealing pale yellow, but not too straw-like colour.

## Nose

There is a strong aroma of honey itself, not far off the aroma of raw
honey.

## Taste

The initial taste is that of pure, liquid honey. The medium body only
adds to the sensation that you are drinking a liquid form of
honey. There are subtle spice undertones that are hard to pinpoint and there is a slight dryness to the finish that adds some complexity.

## Food pairings

The flavours in this metheglin immediately bring to mind the taste of Welsh cakes, so I would strongly suggest pairing these two together.
