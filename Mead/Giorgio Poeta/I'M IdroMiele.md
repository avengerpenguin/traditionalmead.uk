This Italian mead is an interesting, lightly sparking drink fermented from a blend of three floral honeys: Acacia, Stachys and Sunflower. It is fermented over 15 months, which gives it a complex mix of flavours.

I'M IdroMiele is produced by [[Azienda Agricola Giorgio Poeta]] in Fabriano in the Italian region of the Marche. This producer appears to sell an acacia honey spiced with star anise, a honey aged in oak barrels named "Il Carato" (The Carat) and also a "Grand Cru" version of the latter -- only in Italy!

The version I have appears to be "barricato" (aged in oak), so tasting notes might be different if it is possible to source a version that is not oak aged.

## Appearance

A pale gold with a overture of effervescence when freshly opened.

## Nose

A slight floral hint with notes of olive oil. This is perhaps
olfactorily clich√© given the mead's Italian origin, but there is a genuine nose reminiscent of olives.

## Taste

An initial onset of muted sweetness accompanied with peaches and pineapple, leading away to a dryness that lingers -- perhaps even a tartness and texture akin to an under-sweetened lemon curd.

The producer's website claims the French oak barrels lend notes of
sandalwood, black pepper and ripe peach (il sandalo, il pepe nero e la pesca matura).
