This is a [[Mead Liqueurs|mead liqueur]] made by Celtic Country Wines. The liqueur is made with whisky and weighs in at a typical 20% ABV.

Overall, the liqueur doesn't differ too much from their [Celteg pure "Medieval" mead](/celteg-medieval-mead/). If anything, a 20% liqueur that drinks like a sweet mead might be considered a little dangerous!

## Appearance

The colour is a light straw colour and the liqueur is very clear in appearance.

## Nose

The nose isn't overwhelmed with whisky or spirit as can be the case for some
liqueurs. The main aroma is the honey itself with perhaps a hint of
alcohol fortification.

## Taste

The taste is very similar to their [[Celteg Medieval Mead|Medieval Mead]] with the whisky provided a subtle, additional warmth. There is a slight burn from the alcohol in the finish.
