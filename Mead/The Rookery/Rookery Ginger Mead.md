This is the ginger version of the "Scottish [[Craft Mead]]" produced by [[The Rookery]]. It is a more subtle, gentler metheglin
than the lavender counterpart.

The bottle advertises fresh ginger root with Scottish heather honey
which comes together for a gentle, refreshing drink.

This is a good mead for drinking by itself, but there may be some
adventurous food pairings you could try. Let us know in the comments
if you find one! The warming sensation of the ginger might make this a good mead for the Autumn and Winter months.

## Appearance

The colour is somewhat orange, but with a clarity that allows the
light to shine through.

## Nose

The ginger is subtle in the aroma. Some robust honey notes stand
strong. A bit of a swirl around the glass does liven up the ginger though.

## Taste

I'm normally not as keen on any drink that overdoes the ginger
flavouring as it makes a drink difficult to finish. Normally, I opt
for things that have a subtle hint of the spice and this mead is
somewhere in between the extremes.

The initial taste hits with a robust taste from the honey that mellows out to a strong ginger spice on the finish. This gives a complexity where a strong body holds the spice as opposed to a weaker drink that would be overpowered by it.
