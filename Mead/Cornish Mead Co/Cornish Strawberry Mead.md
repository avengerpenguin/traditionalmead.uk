A strawberry-flavoured [pyment](/pyment/)
(does it count as a [melomel](/melomel/)?)
from [Cornish Mead Co](/cornish-mead-co/).

This range of drinks is sold in 25cl and 75cl bottles, so we bought a few gift packs of the smaller ones to give each one a try! Their range of [[Pyment]]/melomel drinks seem to be all made from the same grape base.

## Appearance

This drink has a deep, opaque ruby colour.

## Nose

The nose is subtle compared to some melomels. There are clear strawberry notes, but embedded in a more general fruit body from the grape. 

## Taste

The grape fruit comes first in a semi-dry initial taste and the finish draws out the strawberry sweetness. The alcohol seems more discernible in this drink compared to the rest of their range, which gives a warming feel in the mouth.

## Mead Cocktails

[[Cornish Mead Co]] suggest a cocktail recipe called [Fizz Bang Wallop](https://www.cornishmead.co.uk/cocktails/fizz-bang-wallop/) which contains some bold ingredients -- sloe gin and [Chambord](https://www.masterofmalt.com/liqueurs/chambord-liqueur/?srh=1) -- topped up with prosecco.
