A fruit-flavoured [pyment](/pyment/) (does it count as a [melomel](/melomel/)?) from [Cornish Mead Co](/cornish-mead-co/).

This range of drinks is sold in 25cl and 75cl bottles, so we bought a few gift packs of the smaller ones to give each one a try! Their range of [[Pyment]]/melomel drinks seem to be all made from the same grape base in nearly all cases.

## Appearance

The colour is a medium red that might even be a little on the tawny side. This makes its appearance pass for a medium-bodied red wine. This might be the due the grapes more than the cherry flavouring. 

## Nose

I expected cherry to be more pronounced and aromatic on the nose, but this drink's aroma is surprisingly muted with the cherry hidden behind a more general fruit nose.

## Taste

As with the aroma, a more muted, semi-dry hits you on the first sip and the sweeter, cherry notes come after. I normally find cherry-flavoured things too pungent or tart, but this drink manages to balance cherry, sugar and grape base quite well.

## Mead Cocktails

The Cornish Mead Co's own website suggests a cocktail called
[Cornish Breakfast](https://www.cornishmead.co.uk/cocktails/cornish-breakfast/ made up of their cherry mead, vodka and orange liqueur.

I expect that will blend well like a variant of a [Cosmopolitan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_(cocktail)) but perhaps that little bit sweeter and with cherry notes instead of cranberry.
