Named after Ã†gir, a sea giant from Norse mythology, this mead from
[[The Lancashire Mead Company]] is a [[Melomel (Fruit-flavoured Mead)]] flavoured with orange juice and English Breakfast tea.

The colour is golden with slight hints of orange. The alcohol streaks
impressively on the glass, which isn't surprising with its 17% ABV strength.
