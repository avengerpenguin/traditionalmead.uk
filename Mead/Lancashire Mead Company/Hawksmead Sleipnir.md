Made with raw honey and treacle, this is a very dark mead from
[The Lancashire Mead Company](/the-lancashire-mead-company/). This mead from their "Hawksmead" range is named Sleipnir after
Odin's war horse (and Loki's son -- now that's a story!)

From their own website:

    From Loki we have therefore created 'son' of Loki. Tasting like treacle toffee, this is a sweet, dark mead against the savoury of Loki. Cleverly disguising it's 17% abv, it deposits a delicious and delectable hint of treacle toffee on the palate, that leaves you wanting more!

    Sleipnir, the son of Loki. Loki was a shape-shifter and appeared as a stallion and bred with a mare. The result was Sleipnir, an eight legged horse. Such was the speed that Sleipnir could travel that Odin, the All-father, took him as his war horse.

A lot of homebrewers like to use maple syrup, molasses or treacle instead of honey. When maple syrup is fermented alone, it is known as
[[Types of Mead|Acerglyn]]. In this case, however, the ingredients seem to be a mix of raw honey and treacle, so I suppose this is still technically a mead.

## Appearance

The colour is what you'd expect from something containing treacle. It is dark with honey colours only highlighting the meniscus of the liquid. At 17% ABV, the legs are quite noticeable if you swirl the glass around.

## Nose

The aroma is almost exactly that of treacle toffee. There is little in terms of an overpowering alcohol scent at all.

## Taste

Clearly, treacle toffee is a perfect flavour if you are looking to hide the alcohol in a drink. The first sip is a bold taste of liquid treacle toffee with a substantial mouth feel approaching that of a single cream (or at least whole milk). There is a small amount of heat from the alcohol in the finish only. The toffee notes hang on into the aftertaste for a very pleasing finish indeed.
