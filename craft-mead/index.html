    <h1>Craft&nbsp;Mead</h1>
    

    <p>Mead has seen quite a resurgence in recent years. Some have attributed it to <span class="caps">TV</span> shows like Game of Thrones, but a lot of newer producers seem to have taken inspiration from the rise of craft beer and&nbsp;cider.</p>
<p>In a traditional mead recipe, it is common to ferment until fermentation stops naturally. This produces a wine-strength drink with residual sugar left in most cases (since honey is so high in sugar) as most yeasts will be killed off around 14% to 15% <span class="caps">ABV</span>. However, we are now seeing meads from producers such as Zymurgorium, Gosnells, and Mabinogion made in the 5% to 7% <span class="caps">ABV</span> range. These are more comparable (and drinkable) like a craft&nbsp;beer.</p>
<p>The prolific Scottish producer, <a href="/the-rookery/">The Rookery</a>, makes mead under the &#8220;craft mead&#8221; label as well, but their offerings are higher than wine strength even. In this case, it appears they are referring to the small-batch, hand-made approach to their mead&nbsp;production.</p>
<p>These &#8220;craft&#8221; meads represent a very modern revival of mead. While there is  also a rise in producers making traditional meads, melomels and metheglins, the craft producers are bringing some unusual twists and eccentric creativity in some&nbsp;cases.</p>
<p>We only have to look at anything made by <a href="/zymurgorium/">Zymurgorium</a> to see the embodiment of the craft movement out of Greater Manchester in the form of mead, gins and liqueurs. Their meads &#8212; as it the case with <a href="/gosnells/">Gosnells</a> &#8212; are all made to beer strength and sold in 300ml
bottles. In fact, in many cases their labels would blend in with a fridge full of craft&nbsp;beers.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="/the-rookery/">The Rookery</a>, we are seeing a producer creating
so many interesting flavours of meads, that we&#8217;re yet to try even half of&nbsp;them!</p>
