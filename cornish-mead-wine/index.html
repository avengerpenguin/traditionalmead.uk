<p>A <a href="/pyment/">pyment</a> from <a href="/cornish-mead-co/">Cornish Mead Co</a>. Most of
their range is a fruit flavour on top of a grape base, so presumably
this is the grape base on its&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>This drink comes in at a mere 14% <span class="caps">ABV</span> whereas many of their
fruit-flavoured wines are typically 17%. Perhaps the more
intense flavours carry a higher alcohol&nbsp;better.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>The colour is a burnt orange as you might expect from
darker pure-honey meads. This might be the effect of a
lighter honey lightening a red grape base or a darker
honey tainting a white grape base. It&#8217;s hard to tell&nbsp;which.</p>
<h2 id="nose">Nose</h2>
<p>The nose is less pronounced without the fruit flavourings
in their other offerings. There are hints of honey and an
almost chemical aroma deep in the&nbsp;bouquet.</p>
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>
<p>The body is quite light and thing, but not overly so. This
makes it quite quaffable, but the honey flavour is quite
subtle. There is some acidity, but no bitterness or tartness,
suggesting it is a white wine base with honey&nbsp;added.</p>
<p>They advertise the wine as &#8220;tantalisingly smooth&#8221; and it is
indeed smooth and drinkable as a drink on its own, but does
not stand out as remarkable in its flavour compared to 
more complex meads and&nbsp;pyments.</p>
<h2 id="mead-cocktails">Mead&nbsp;Cocktails</h2>
<p>The Cornish Mead Co suggest mixing this honey wine in a cocktail
they call
<a href="https://www.cornishmead.co.uk/cocktails/blood-and-honey/">Blood <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Honey</a>
served with blood orange, gin and
<a href="https://www.masterofmalt.com/bitters/campari-bitters/?srh=1">Campari</a>.</p>
