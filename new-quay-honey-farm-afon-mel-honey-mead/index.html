    <h1>Afon Mêl Honey&nbsp;Mead</h1>
    

    <p><img alt="" src="/images/afon-mel-honey.jpg"></p>
<p>This is a &#8220;Welsh honey mead&#8221; from the <a href="/new-quay-honey-farm/">New Quay Honey Farm</a>. They produce a variety of flavours, but this appears to be their &#8220;pure&#8221; honey mead&nbsp;offering.</p>
<p>The farm is based in Ceredigion and has been a bee-keeping farm since 1995. Today they produce honeys, meads, sweets and other products dervived from&nbsp;honey.</p>
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

<p>They claim to ferment at ambient temperatures using <a href="/wildflower-honey/">Wildflower Honey</a> from their own hives before maturing in casks for a mature flavour. Their process supposedly takes two years, so we would hope for some good results at the end of that&nbsp;period!</p>
<p>This classic mead comes in both a sweet and medium versions. It is the sweet version tasted&nbsp;below.</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>This mead is a quite light in colour, but not as light as something
graped-based like <a href="/lindisfarne/">Lindisfarne mead</a>. The legs really cling to the glass which made me think it was a lot stronger than the 13% <span class="caps">ABV</span> as it says on the&nbsp;bottle.</p>
<h2 id="nose">Nose</h2>
<p>This is definitely not shy on the aroma! Quite a few simple means manage to summon only a whiff of sweetness, but this packs a sweet and tangy punch that opens up your&nbsp;nostrils.</p>
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>
<p>The initial taste brings a duality of sweetness and acidity. There are notes of apricot perhaps and it finishes with a toastiness (toasted&nbsp;broiche?).</p>
