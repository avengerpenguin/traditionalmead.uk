Metheglin is a variant of mead made traditionally with herbs and spices adding
for additional flavours.

Metheglin has its origins in folk medicines. The Welsh for mead is _medd_
and _meddyglyn_ came from a combination of _meddyg_ (healing/medicine) and
_llyn_ (liquor). This gives rise to the English word Metheglin today.
