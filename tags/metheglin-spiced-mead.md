Metheglin is a variant of mead made traditionally with herbs and spices adding
for additional flavours. This is distinct from a mead actually made spicy
using chillies, which would be a capsicumel.

Metheglin has its origins in folk medicines. The Welsh for mead is _medd_
and _meddyglyn_ came from a combination of _meddyg_ (healing/medicine) and
_llyn_ (liquor). This gives rise to the English word Metheglin today.

Today, it is far more common to find metheglins brewed with sweet spices
rather than herbs as the combination of honey and spice produced a very
warming drink. Many spiced meads or metheglins are incredibly popular around
Winter and Christmas time served heated as an alternative to mulled wine. We
can highly recommend it if you haven't tried it!

Due to this common pairing of Christmas and sweet spices, it may be no
surprise that many mead producers have a "Christmas mead" in their offerings.
See our page specifically on [Christmas meads](/christmas-meads/) for a full
list, but the most well-known is probably
[Lyme Bay's Christmas mead](/lyme-bay-christmas/).

[Friary liqueurs](/friary-liqueurs) produce a different, but equally enjoyable
[Christmas mead](/friary-christmas-mead/) which might be a sensible purchase
if you are ordering in a variety of liqueurs at the same time for the
festive season.

Of course, any metheglin packed with sweet spice flavours is going to be a
delightfully warming tipple in the Winter months, so feel free to try any of
the delicious metheglins we have found so far below.
