A capsicumel is any mead flavoured with chillies. This is distinct from a
[metheglin](/metheglin/) (where sweet spices and herbs are used) as the
goal with these recipes is to add a peppery heat to the drink.

Food with a chilli heat is typically difficult to pair with wines, with beer
being the more common choice to drink with things like Indian curries. This
difficulty comes from the effect whereby alcohol exacerbates the burning
sensation from hot chillies. The dry acidity from typical white grape wines
tends to pair poorly with spicy food as well.

The aim with a capsicumel is to embrace that increased burn sensation from
the combination of the alcohol and the heat. This is, of course, down to
personal taste as to whether that strong burning sensation is desirable or not.
It cannot be denied however that there is a market even for chilli vodka.

The flavour profile is not always so extreme though. It is common to suggest
low-acid, off-dry or sweeter wines with spicy food, so mead by itself pairs
quite nicely with heat. In fact, one of our favourite combinations is
[Afon MÃªl apricot mead](afon-mel-cpricot-mead) with Middle Eastern or
Indian food.

The pairing works because the sweetness is decreased by the presence of chilli
heat in the mouth. This not only makes dry wines inappropriate (they would
taste even more dry), but reducing the pure sweet taste in the mouth gives a
chance for other flavour characteristics to emerge. This is something you can
find in [dry meads](/dry-meads/) where other honey flavours are more apparent
when more sugar is fermented away.

As a result, with a (potentially) very sweet drink like mead, simply adding a
little bit of chilli heat can add subtle complexity. One great example of this
is the "Ah Mucen Cab" below. This drink has only a small amount of heat and
has great complexity as a result of this (as well as all the other
flavourings!).
