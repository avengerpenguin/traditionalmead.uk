The most famous mead associated with Scotland is probably
[Moniack mead](/moniack-mead/). It is named after Moniack castle near
Inverness, but production has moved down to Devon after
[Highland Wineries](/highland-wineries/) was fully bought by
[Lyme Bay Winery](/lyme-bay-winery/). We have kept the "Scottish" tag on this
mead to honour its history, but we must also acknowledge truly Scottish mead
producers too.

The most impressive we have come across so far is [The Rookery](/the-rookery/),
who produce ["Craft mead"](/craft-mead/) in Perthshire. Read more about them
on [our page on The Rookery](/the-rookery/).

We have also stumbled across Beehive Brae
([see their website](http://www.beehivebrae.uk/)) thanks to
[an article in The Herald](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13412281.Game_of_Thrones_fuels_Scottish_mead_sales/)
claiming they saw a huge boost in sales thanks to Game of Thrones. Sales from
their mead and honey beer go to support [Plan Bee](https://www.planbeeltd.com/),
an initiative to promote corporate adoption of bee hives for sustainability.

We have struggled so far to find more producers in Scotland. England seems
to be dominating the more modern "craft" scene with trendy producers such
as [Zymurgorium](/zymurgorium/) while both Wales and South-West England do
well for the more traditional approaches with
[New Quay Honey Farm's Afon MÃªl](/new-quay-honey-farm/) and
[Lyme Bay](/lyme-bay-winery/).

Do you know of any more producers in Scotland we are yet to find? Please let
us know in the comments!
