Christmas is the best time of year for food and drink lovers. Not only does the
festive season bring a good excuse to spend more on a wider variety of foods
and beverages, but the approach of the Winter nights draws more of us inside
with family and friends.

What better way to get through the Winter than with
warm, comforting food and sharing a variety of drinks with friends?

Mead serves well as a dessert wine as well as a drink on its own, so it clearly
perfect after Christmas dinner or for any Christmas party. It is at Christmas
time though where a sweet, spiced [metheglin](/metheglin-spiced-mead/) comes
into its own.

Christmas is widely associated with sweet treats and sweet spices such as
cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, so it should be no surprise that many mead
producers market some form of "Christmas mead" where they have made a metheglin
flavoured with these precise spices.

The meads below are any produced that are labelled explicitly as a
"Christmas mead" as opposed to just any metheglin. This normally shows a bias
towards the Christmas spices and they might be the best pairings with your
Christmas pudding this year!
