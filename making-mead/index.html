<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Honey (1.4kg or 3lb) &#8212; Use real, natural honey for the best&nbsp;results.</li>
<li>Distilled water (1 gallon or&nbsp;3.8l)</li>
<li>Yeast</li>
<li>Any other flavourings such as fruit or&nbsp;spices</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>Fully sterlise any equipment as the fermentation process is favourable to 
growth of bacteria and other microorganisms too. Many of the kits listed 
above come with a sterilising solution or&nbsp;powder.</p>
<h2 id="make-up-must-mixture-for-your-mead">Make up &#8220;must&#8221; mixture for your&nbsp;mead</h2>
<p>First you need to liquify your honey (preferably using a warm water bath) and
then mix it with the distilled water. There is no need to heat or boil this
mixture. You now have what is known as &#8220;must&#8221; (the same term used in wine
making). At this point you can optionally mix in fruits or spices to add some
unique flavour to your&nbsp;mead.</p>
<p>Now you can add the yeast to your must. Some yeasts require some rehydration
first, so check the label for any&nbsp;instructions.</p>
<h2 id="store-and-ferment-your-mead">Store and ferment your&nbsp;mead</h2>
<p>Place in a fermantation bucket or any other large, sterilised container. You
 want to ensure the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The container should not beoverly full &#8212; leave room for a lively&nbsp;fermentation!</li>
<li>You need to stop air getting in, while still allowing carbon dioxide to
   escape. Many of the kits listed above come with a proper airlock, but a 
   you can get away with poking holes in a balloon and 
   stretching over the top of the container (secure with tape or an elastic&nbsp;band).</li>
<li>Leave the mead fermenting in a location that keeps it at the right 
 temperature. Check the label for your yeast to see if any particular 
 temperature is&nbsp;recommended.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="check-the-gravity">Check the&nbsp;gravity</h2>
<p><em>Specific gravity</em> (<span class="caps">SG</span>) is the density of your must at any time. You can get 
the <em>original gravity</em> (<span class="caps">OG</span>) by measuring with a hydrometer. Pure water has an 
<span class="caps">SG</span> of exactly 1, so your mixture is going to be something like 1.100 (each 
1lb of honey seems to add 0.035 of&nbsp;gravity).</p>
<p><span class="caps">SG</span> is expected to go down (attentuate) during the fermentation process as 
the yeast converts the sugars into&nbsp;alcohol.</p>
<p>You can predict what the <em>final gravity</em> (<span class="caps">FG</span>) will be by predicting how much
sugar your yeast will convert into alcohol. First we can use a simple 
formula that estimates the <span class="caps">ABV</span> of your fermented&nbsp;drink:</p>
<pre><code>(OG - FG) x 131 = ABV
</code></pre>
<p>That is, if your original gravity is 1.100 and then you measure the final 
gravity after fermentation stops to get 1.005, then you can plug <span class="caps">OG</span> and <span class="caps">FG</span> 
into the formula above to&nbsp;get:</p>
<pre><code>(1.100 - 1.005) x 131 = (0.095) x 131 = 12.4%
</code></pre>
<p>Your yeast should have a known alcohol tolerance. For example, Lalvin 
<span class="caps">EC</span>-1118 is a popular Champagne yeast that is good for making a strong mead 
and its rated tolerance is&nbsp;18%.</p>
<p>If we use that tolerance as an estimate for what our final <span class="caps">ABV</span> will be, we
can use the formula above in&nbsp;reverse:</p>
<pre><code>OG - (ABV / 131) = FG
</code></pre>
<p>And then plug in 18% as our estimated final <span class="caps">ABV</span> along with an example original
gravity of 1.150 (this example is higher as more honey is needed for such a 
strong&nbsp;mead):</p>
<pre><code>FG = 1.150 - (18 / 131) = 1.150 - 0.138 = 1.012
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if the original gravity had been 0.100 as per our first example, the
formula would suggest a <span class="caps">FG</span> below 1, which is impossible! In that case, it&#8217;s 
telling us that the yeast would ferment all the sugar out of the must and 
the final mead will be quite&nbsp;dry.</p>
<p>If you want to retain some sweetness to your final mead, choose an <span class="caps">ABV</span> for 
the formula 1% or so above what the yeast can manage. So we might make a 
must with an original gravity that would create an <span class="caps">ABV</span> of 19% or 20% for a 
yeast with a tolerance of 18%. This ensures that fermentation stops <em>before</em>
all the sugar turns into&nbsp;alcohol.</p>
<h2 id="aerate-for-the-first-sugar-break">Aerate for the first sugar&nbsp;break</h2>
<p>Once we know the estimated, final gravity (<span class="caps">FG</span>), we can get the attenuation 
from the simple different of <span class="caps">OG</span> and <span class="caps">FG</span>,&nbsp;e.g.</p>
<pre><code>Attenuation = OG - FG = 1.100 - 1.005 = 0.095
</code></pre>
<p>If we divide that number into thirds (e.g. 0.032), then our first sugar break
is&nbsp;at:</p>
<pre><code>1.100 - 0.032 = 1.068
</code></pre>
<p>In our example here, the yeast needs aerating (i.e. allow oxygen in) while the
specific gravity is between 1.100 and 1.068. Ensure that you aerate daily for
that first third of gravity attenuation, maybe more than once a day if you&nbsp;can.</p>
<h2 id="wait">Wait</h2>
<p>You will need to ferment for probably at leaast 8 weeks. You can bottle 
after that time if you wish, but there&#8217;s a few more nuanced things to look 
out for if you want to be more&nbsp;precise.</p>
<p>A simple sign that fermentation has stopped is when the bubbling has stopped.
If you are using an air lock and see no bubble for 3 weeks, then you&#8217;re good
to&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>Another sign is that there is no change in your specific gravity for several&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Image titled Make Mead Step&nbsp;66</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to know when the mead is done&nbsp;fermenting:[2]</p>
<p>The most accurate way to know is to measure the specific gravity with a
hydrometer when you first mix it, then measure it every two weeks. The chosen
yeast has a published <span class="caps">ABV</span> tolerance, and the hydrometer reading can be used to
determine what the final gravity of the mead should be. When the mead reaches
this gravity, wait a minimum of 4-6 months before bottling to ensure all <span class="caps">CO2</span>
that was in suspension in the mead has degassed. If the mead has not properly
degassed and too much <span class="caps">CO2</span> for the rating of the type of bottle the mead is
bottled in is transferred, there is a risk of bottle explosion with temperature&nbsp;swings.</p>
<p>Wait at least 8 weeks. The amount of time it takes for the mead to ferment will
depend on a variety of factors, but 8 weeks should be enough time for most&nbsp;scenarios.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using an airlock, wait until 3 weeks after it stops&nbsp;bubbling.</p>
<h2 id="age-your-mead">Age your&nbsp;mead</h2>
<p>Transfer your fermented must to a large container such as a demijohn to 
store for aging. Make sure there is no space for air if possible. We want to
minimise the amount of mead touching the&nbsp;air.</p>
<p>The longer you spend aging the mead, the better. You will probably want to 
leave this for a good 6 to 8 months, but some advice on other sites 
advocates bottling after 2-3&nbsp;months!</p>
<h2 id="bottle-it">Bottle&nbsp;it!</h2>
<p>Transfer the mead into bottles, seal, and store in a cool dark place. Open 
and enjoy when you feel the need for&nbsp;mead.</p>
