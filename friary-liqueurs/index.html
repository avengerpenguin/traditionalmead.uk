    <h1>Friary&nbsp;Liqueurs</h1>
    

    <p>Friary Liqueurs are a family-run liqueur company based in Frome, Somerset. They hand-craft liqueurs and meads in small batches (under 100&nbsp;litres).</p>
<p>They are predominantly a producer of liqueurs with a series flavoured
vodka liqueurs, gin liqueurs and most importantly a handful of meads. In this respect, you might consider them a liqueur producer who includes mead in their range rather than a dedicated mead maker. Whether there is any benefit of such a focus is something you can judge yourself by&nbsp;drinking!</p>
<p>Many of their drinks are sold in bottles with interesting shapes, such as Christmas trees, heart shapes or stars, which could make them a good choice for interesting&nbsp;gifts.</p>
<p>So far, we have got our hands on a traditional (pure honey) mead, a
spiced mead (metheglin), a &#8220;Christmas mead&#8221; which is also spiced and
finally a mead liqueur from their &#8220;Classic Collection&#8221;. This collection is made up of other fruit-based liqueurs such as apple, ginger, apricot brandy and a sloe&nbsp;liqueur.</p>
<p>There are many others of course, but our focus will be on the mead&nbsp;liqueurs!</p>
<p>As Friary specialise in all sorts of liqueurs, there isn&#8217;t much specific information given about the ingredients for their meads or
the kind of honey used. Again, a dedicated mead maker might want to show off a bit more with their choice of&nbsp;ingredients.</p>
<p>Their website does claim however that they select and source the
&#8220;finest ingredients&#8221;, so given their hand-crafting approach I would
assume they have put some thought into&nbsp;it!</p>
