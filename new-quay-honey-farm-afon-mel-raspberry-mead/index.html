    <h1>Afon Mêl Raspberry&nbsp;Mead</h1>
    

    <p><img alt="Picture of Afon Mêl Raspberry Mead" src="https://www.thehoneyfarm.co.uk/cms/catalog/21_0.jpg"></p>
<p>This is the raspberry offering from the <a href="/new-quay-honey-farm/">New Quay Honey Farm</a>. This makes it a <a href="/melomel-fruit-flavoured-mead/">melomel</a> rather than a pure honey&nbsp;mead.</p>
<p>Raspberry is definitely a dessert fruit, so it is unlikely you would
pair this with any savoury food. I have seen one article claim that a
dry raspberry fruit wine might pair with turkey or cornish game
hen. This is definitely a mead and not dry, but perhaps it&#8217;s worth a try around&nbsp;Christmas!</p>
<p>Raspberry and white chocolate are a classic pairing in many desserts
and baked goods, so it stands to reason we might pair raspberry mead
with a white chocolate cheesecake or other similar desserts. Let us
know in the comments below if you&#8217;ve tried&nbsp;this!</p>
<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>The body is a deep red-brown colour you would see in a jar of
raspberry jam. The colour is lighter towards the&nbsp;edges.</p>
<h2 id="nose">Nose</h2>
<p>The raspberry aroma is immediately notable simply upon opening the
bottle. Closer to the glass, there are bolder notes from the alcohol
and the&nbsp;honey.</p>
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>
<p>The raspberry flavour suggests similarities with raspberry jam, but the initial taste is actually a little more tart and complex. The
comparisons to jam are not totally unwarranted as there is the
expected blend of raspberry and sweetness. Some of the complexity
might come from the honey base, which is certainly evident in the&nbsp;finish.</p>
<h2 id="mixing">Mixing</h2>
<p>Given the jammy intensity of this mead, it dilutes nicely with an extra-dry prosecco for a chilled, refreshing summer&nbsp;drink.</p>
